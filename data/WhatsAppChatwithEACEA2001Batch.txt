04/01/2021, 6:40 am - +91 6238 514 418: Did u meet them up at a function or programme...Devi?
04/01/2021, 6:43 am - Devi CEA: Neha is a trained singer whose feel and rendering is right from the first take..I had the opportunity to see a  recording and it amazed me how in all the recording chaos and madness she was grounded to start at the right pitch note...just one gyan...everything in the world has a pitch starting from a clang sound of metal to a crow crying out in the open to even people speaking there is a pitch..and this lady in all the chaos of sounds in a studio can start in the right pitch..she is soo hardwired that way.
04/01/2021, 6:46 am - Devi CEA: Common friend who took me for a recording, this was the rosebowl channel days where recording was in kowdiar,  young talent was scouted for..then it was orkut those days so used to chat up and discuss music...70s rock and malayalam songs.. .but then we got on the fast track laters and didn't keep in touch.....sadly ...She has some good tracks..I'll share this Friday..
04/01/2021, 6:47 am - +91 6238 514 418: Yes pls do...
04/01/2021, 6:58 am - Devi CEA: https://youtu.be/kRrrRPUEowQ
04/01/2021, 7:01 am - Devi CEA: This was the recording I want for...maybe 17 yrs back...  😉...it's a pathos song so may be sentimental for the morning but the sound quality and intricate singing in the second stanza s worth a hear....Her singing has good base and breathing high pitch...base ullathu kondu high notes don't fly in the air but sit firmly on the base ..
04/01/2021, 7:08 am - +91 6238 514 418: Beautiful!!!

06/01/2021, 11:04 am - Devi CEA: ☝️☝️16 year old navneet born and brought up in America, parents from Kannur.  New gen is simply groomed correctly but also focussed on the things that matter to them I believe... Devarajan master has been analysed bone to bone...For those interested in Raga break down this is a good twenty minute video..this young boy has got talent and has the feel of the ragas already.....personally I felt hes trying too hard for perfect rendering at the notes level..sometimes a slip and slide in notes sounds good infact
06/01/2021, 11:04 am - Rahul Engg: 😀
06/01/2021, 11:05 am - Rahul Engg: .. long story include politics , finance and history..
06/01/2021, 11:05 am - Rahul Engg: Let me brief..
06/01/2021, 11:07 am - Rahul Engg: .. in indian mobile era, private operators start with huge tariff.. of around 14/- per min for outgoing and 8/- for incoming.. in the end of 90s.. u may remember our college days.. 🍃
06/01/2021, 11:08 am - Deepu CEA: yeah i still remember charging mobile for 90 Rs which will cost you around 250 /-
06/01/2021, 11:09 am - Rahul Engg: BSNL started mobile service on Oct 2000 with a revolutionary change.. of free incoming and moderately economic outgoing plans..
06/01/2021, 11:09 am - Rahul Engg: ..no doubt customers flood to BSNL offices..
06/01/2021, 11:10 am - Rahul Engg: We became no 1 in very low time..
06/01/2021, 11:11 am - Devi CEA: Guys ..😁....lovely communication going on.....let's continue this through in the best interest of sharing knowledge in the group as we come from many political and religious conditioning....Thought I'd just drop a word....let's  continue this good spirit of sharing info..👍👍....nadakkatte
06/01/2021, 11:12 am - Deepu CEA: He is good.. there are many such videos.. they will teach how to render songs easily
06/01/2021, 11:13 am - Deepu CEA: nadakkaan povukayaano
06/01/2021, 11:15 am - Devi CEA: This railwire broadband is also eating Into the bsnl pie I feel...in Kayamkulam I use BSNL..pretty decent service..but many have converted to railwire..which is the internet service at railways..
06/01/2021, 11:16 am - Rahul Engg: ..so our private counterparts played well at 3G launch in 2008.. at first BSNL didn't allowed spectrum.. and others enjoyed selling sims.. again.. when govt untied us, history repeated, BSNL became no 1 in sim sale..
06/01/2021, 11:18 am - Devi CEA: Athinidakku....🤦‍♂️💁
06/01/2021, 11:30 am - Rahul Engg: .. in 2018 Jio entered and used all their money/ politics / gujarathi relationship/ caste spirits.. anything for their business..
06/01/2021, 11:32 am - Deepu CEA: just like they handled Indian Airlines.. it was one of the largest airlines in the world
06/01/2021, 11:33 am - Deepu CEA: That time it was Mallya .. for Kisg fisher
06/01/2021, 11:34 am - Rahul Engg: .. killed other private operators ( docomo, mts, Uninor, videocon, aircel, Etisalat, reliance etc) and  others tied us with political power..
06/01/2021, 11:35 am - Umesh CEA: good..information..👍
06/01/2021, 11:35 am - Rahul Engg: When BSNL ready to start 4G equipment, govt blocked as vendors should be indian.. unfortunately no indian companies produce such equipments.. while jio use European and Airtel & Vi use Chinese..
06/01/2021, 11:36 am - Rahul Engg: .. u may get a rough idea.. seems.. 😌
06/01/2021, 11:37 am - Umesh CEA: one thing is isn't jio on different technology
06/01/2021, 11:38 am - Umesh CEA: why was vodafone, airtel being such big players not give us such benefit earlier
06/01/2021, 11:48 am - Rahul Engg: ..doing business for profit only.. we buy for 100/- and to be sell atleast for 110/- .. ( so much costs of crores.. spectrum fee, equipment, maintanence,  salary, wages, power supply, Diesel, rent, vehicle, conveyance, miscellaneous etc)
Now due to Jio's wrong business tactics, we all forced to sell for 50/-.. so all r in loss.. ofcourse Jio too.. but they make up with their oil business.. others can't..
06/01/2021, 11:50 am - Rahul Engg: ..they plan for a monopoly..
06/01/2021, 11:50 am - Rahul Engg: ..not only in telecom..
06/01/2021, 11:51 am - Rahul Engg: ..oil, power supply, food n grocery, broadcasting..
06/01/2021, 11:55 am - Umesh CEA: Reliance was in business since ages and they also started like us common man but any government they have a say...coz they are huge..but all I am thinking is just putting the onus on only them may not be right..there are other players too..Airtel was an established player..vodafone was also there..if you talk about private players then they did not innovate as Jio did..as a normal customer I have benefitted from paying monthly Bill's upto 3000 there were days or 1 GB per month to now max 500 and 1.5GB per day..Airtel is still the biggest in terms of numbers
06/01/2021, 11:56 am - Umesh CEA: other sectors definitely they are there to compete..I still remember they started that reliance phone long long ago..and.people duped them did not pay Bill's and finally they stopped that
06/01/2021, 11:57 am - Rahul Engg: ..but v hv to widen our views, na.. don't u see ... farmers protest at Punjab, Haryana, Delhi..
06/01/2021, 11:58 am - Rahul Engg: .. don't u feel, petrol price hike.. hidden politics behind all these..
06/01/2021, 11:58 am - Umesh CEA: let's not get into those protests here..😊
06/01/2021, 11:59 am - Umesh CEA: petrol.price definitely yes..they should reduce...I am definitely for that
06/01/2021, 11:59 am - Rahul Engg: Mobile monopoly - low tariff- oil profit - oil price hike by govt- party fund as 🤝
06/01/2021, 11:59 am - Rahul Engg: ..coz it directly affect u..
06/01/2021, 12:00 pm - Rahul Engg: Let me go back to history again.. sorry for the boredom.. 🙏
06/01/2021, 12:00 pm - Umesh CEA: mobile also directly affects me 😊
06/01/2021, 12:00 pm - Umesh CEA: that's what I told above I see the benefits for me
06/01/2021, 12:02 pm - Umesh CEA: see all.my life I have worked for private firms..if you dont innovate you die...many companies were not able to sustain the competition ...Here daily we have meetings on how to automate, reviews etc..then evaluation..I need not tell all that here..but each and everyone is assessed for performance too
06/01/2021, 12:03 pm - Rahul Engg: In Germany, hitler started killing communists - I said I am not communist,
Then he turned to writers, thinkers, I said I am not either, so he turned to Jews, I said I am not a Jew..
Last he came to me, unfortunately now there was nobody to help me..
06/01/2021, 12:04 pm - Umesh CEA: where is monopoly..Airtel still going strong..leave Ambani out of this for a moment please and we can have more views on this topic. why was Airtel , Vodafone not come.up earlier with such thoughts is my question
06/01/2021, 12:04 pm - Rahul Engg: .. private firm is not a poison..
06/01/2021, 12:04 pm - Umesh CEA: bhai I have seen all these wordings before...😁🙏🙏
06/01/2021, 12:04 pm - Rahul Engg: Tata is excellent..
06/01/2021, 12:04 pm - Rahul Engg: So many examples around us..
06/01/2021, 12:05 pm - Umesh CEA: Reliance had money from Dhirubhai days...they invest in what they see as future..
06/01/2021, 12:05 pm - Rahul Engg: But business monopoly is harm for all,
06/01/2021, 12:06 pm - Rahul Engg: ..Reliance had .. they split.. Now mukesh Jio even killed Anil reliance too..
06/01/2021, 12:07 pm - Umesh CEA: TATA group also does that..they are excelling in IT industry..so can we say they are monopoly there..daily there is competition..now when amazon, facebook and reliance tied up TATA is trying to take over Big Basket..its too late is what I think
06/01/2021, 12:09 pm - Rahul Engg: .. monopoly killing entire market.. other sellers and eventually customer end up in big loss..
06/01/2021, 12:10 pm - Rahul Engg: ..for eg, when opec increase petrol price ( reducing production), US free out their oil stock of lacks of barrels.. to keep the market level..
06/01/2021, 12:10 pm - Umesh CEA: you are not answering my question..why there was so much delay in giving benefit to customers by Airtel and Vodafone..leave BSNL..as you say they are killing it...😊
06/01/2021, 12:11 pm - Umesh CEA: bhai please we can leave other topics for another day..petrol, farmers etc 🙏🙏
06/01/2021, 12:11 pm - Rahul Engg: Otherwise Russia, Venezuela etc play agains US in oil supply..

06/01/2021, 12:15 pm - Umesh CEA: there is cut throat competition everywhere..I used Vodafone an international player not the Indian player for 16 years...the decided to change coz I felt I was being looted for 1 GB per month I had to pay 300 rupees then...
06/01/2021, 12:16 pm - Umesh CEA: ofcourse it's not charity..for charity each company has different wing only dedicated for that..its business..
06/01/2021, 12:17 pm - Deepu CEA: hi guys  ... anyway we all have to suffer... lets hope for the best.. politicians ... unless and until they decides to stand for common people nothing gonna change

06/01/2021, 12:41 pm - Umesh CEA: yes...and I go back..why Vodafone did not go to 1..they did not do what was required..80K crores both airtel and vodafone has to be fine..and Jio has to pay I think 20K around.. so all have to deal.with it..need to consider jio started only some 3 to 4 years ago
06/01/2021, 12:41 pm - Umesh CEA: has to pay*
06/01/2021, 12:51 pm - Rahul Engg: 80k..20k.. what was that..

A new substance injecting to sport person body, which will cause a heart attack- following press release- big queue Infront of all hospitals for doing CT Scan.

08/01/2021, 9:32 am - Umesh CEA: Hospital Industry is the best one since one year for sure.😊It never has been in recession am sure
08/01/2021, 9:33 am - GT Australia: could be the otherway, they may been hit more .
08/01/2021, 9:33 am - Femina: 😃😍
08/01/2021, 9:34 am - GT Australia: For ever headache we used to go to hospitals and now the Corona scare got most of them away from hospitals..
08/01/2021, 9:35 am - GT Australia: Even, those who required some medical attention too are reluctant to visit.. there were lesser surgeries performed - read somewhere
08/01/2021, 9:36 am - GT Australia: That means, there wwere  a lot unncessary surgeries, procedures done, which are under check now
08/01/2021, 9:43 am - Devi CEA: The number of angioplasties, angiograms that was deemed essential for survival, the scans that took care of your organs every six months, the antibiotics for a meagre flue....although humanity depends on medicine now for normalcy to come back, and all respect to doctors...more than anything these survival stuff are questionable...
08/01/2021, 9:44 am - Umesh CEA: That's there..but I have seen hospitals in few months now...its all back to normal..though may not be as much crowd as before..the mask is done the trick too..we do not have that infections detect that comes with the dust outside and even the car we travel.in
08/01/2021, 9:44 am - Umesh CEA: 👍
08/01/2021, 10:19 am - +91 80890 89031: It has slowed down... In the sense, people initially stopped going to hospitals unless the patient almost died. Now, patients have started going as required, however cautious enough to avoid going if its not critical.
08/01/2021, 10:21 am - +91 80890 89031: But, while the strain on the hospital staff has increased, the salary etc has seen no change and was subject to cuts during few months.
08/01/2021, 10:22 am - +91 80890 89031: 👆Data based on hospitals in TVM and Kerala***
08/01/2021, 10:24 am - +91 80890 89031: May be.
The problem was that even necessary were postponed. So, mortality rates went high because people would go to hospital and for surgeries when their health deteriorated to the point that post surgery recovery was difficult for the bodies...
08/01/2021, 10:35 am - Anisha ranjith: True..
08/01/2021, 10:36 am - Anisha ranjith: Here hospitals started video call for appointments

08/01/2021, 10:45 am - Umesh CEA: its changed the way hospitals operate..its for the good in a way..Tele appointments here as well..so we need not go..going forward always if we wear a mask when going outside will be good I believe..
08/01/2021, 10:49 am - Umesh CEA: 👍
08/01/2021, 10:50 am - Umesh CEA: The only sad part is the PPE kit that they have to wear for testing covid..otherwise everyone is just wearing a mask now in hospitals..

09/01/2021, 9:22 am - +91 80890 89031: 😁😁😁 Why?
Unless you are hiding your profile for a reason, this is pretty OK, I feel. 
But even then there are ways to by pass this too.
So, since whatapp is a FB company... Why not?
Moreover what's app messages are encrypted end to end. 
Either ways, I've downloaded Singnal😁.
I also feel 🤔 Elon Musk does not like Mark Zuckerberg.
FB has too much info. But addition of the mobile number and the WhatsApp pay could potentially be a super addictive ambrosia that even the lowest strata of society globally accepts, giving MZucker almost omniscient power.

09/01/2021, 10:38 pm - Athira CEA: Devikutty,😊today is a very special day as it is ur birthday and so I am sending this message along with many hugs and kisses and of course wish u the best of the world, and may u succeed in everything u do in ur life .
We met and became friends .I would never have imagined becoming such a close friend of yours.U have made me understand the importance of having friends, and maintaining relations.( remember our last conversation 2 days back)
Your amazing set of qualities sets u apart from everyone else.... and da, it is 
even more adorable seeing that u r  so unaware of how much of a beautiful soul u are. You light up the group conversations the moment you enter it, the atmosphere changes for better because u are the light, a touch bearer, yet  u r  oblivious of the fact.So magnificent yet self-effacing.
🥰Can I talk about your energy? Boundless! Awesome! Admirable! U tirelessly go about doing all that you believe in. Nothing discourages you, nothing stops you. Once you set your mind on it, you go for it. Da, u r way stronger than u know. You are incredibly powerful.You are awesome and I totally, absolutely love you.U r so many more adjectives (noble, generous, passionate, helpful and implausibly caring), but your kindness is unrelenting and I am certain that it will bring all the awesomosity in the world that you deserve. ☺️
If you think I am writing all of this to make you feel good, then, u r right, because you deserve to know the truth about yourself and you deserve the feeling of goodness that comes with that knowledge.You are empathetic, always watching out for other’s well beings. I want you to know that one someday, one day soon, you will achieve all of your dreams and I will be here to celebrate with you..💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻
And we have known each other for quite some time now. I want us to be friends when I’m old enough to have grand children. And I want us to be friends even when I am sitting on a wheelchair and have no teeth.( 🥴)😅( background senti music)
Happy happy birthday dear. Stay blessed always!!!

11/01/2021, 6:57 am - Devi CEA: Thanks guys for the kind words....would encourage all to share pics during birthdays...It gives you such a boost, and kick...👍🙏🌼
11/01/2021, 7:28 am - Devi CEA: Are we/ should we move to signal NOW is u thought.......should we test the ground a bit before converting I was thinking let's make a signal group and leave it at that until later for a complete transfer....Let's wait and watch cos this unrest abt whatsapp is gaining traction and facebook I think would be compelled to make changes too in the next few weeks...whatsapp has influenced everything we do..appointment mgmt, admin of orders, ecom comms, apartment society reqs...everything...would take a while for it to die. Yes I do not agree to the Privacy breach and especially that we have no choice but to comply.....but an immediate transfer is having another app to manage.....handful already..
11/01/2021, 7:30 am - Devi CEA: Also are we ending up 
 exposing and sharing our data to one more corporation who would then be acquired by another who would then share with a third one
11/01/2021, 7:40 am - Devi CEA: Google knows everything about us - even  more than ourselves .😁your assets, your bank accounts, every transaction you make  every insurance policy  since at some point you must have given that email address...they know how to manage metadata....So that way Google and Amazon owns us already

As long as whatsapp commerce is not used in context of the group I think we can wait and avoid knee jerk..
but knowing Facebook and its unethical practices, it's good to be prepared....
11/01/2021, 7:47 am - Umesh CEA: Everything what you have written is so true..but we are forced to..if you need to connect through phone..you need to have android and then there are updates, phone manufacturers updates etc etc..we have already given all data..as you said google knows more than ourselves which is just a pity..we definitely can test the ground and create a new one and be ready..there are already so much information on how to use Signal..I dont trust Facebook ..
11/01/2021, 7:52 am - Umesh CEA: <Media omitted>
11/01/2021, 7:52 am - Umesh CEA: just some more on the same..its the same what you have mentioned above
11/01/2021, 8:03 am - +91 80890 89031: 😁 1. Dont use FB on your phone as an app. 2.every time you get into FB, use another device like your laptop 3. to access from your mobile, use a private browser that uses VPN. 4. or like me you could use a fake fb profiles on fake mobile numbers on different mobile devices that really would skew up information they have.
11/01/2021, 8:05 am - Athira CEA: 😳seriously? Appol ithreyum naal.... 🥺😫🥴
11/01/2021, 8:06 am - +91 80890 89031: 😎 CEA has taught me how to live off grid if needed...
11/01/2021, 8:07 am - Athira CEA: Inganathe ‘off the grid’ techniques okke neratheee paranju tharandaayirunno!!! So one serious question... should I delete the FB app on my phone?
11/01/2021, 8:09 am - Devi CEA: Yes athi...don't use FB on phone..
11/01/2021, 8:10 am - +91 80890 89031: if you feel the need ...
11/01/2021, 8:10 am - +91 80890 89031: yes

11/01/2021, 8:11 am - +91 80890 89031: but if you have already both apps and have accepted the new whats app terms, the profiles are linked together- it wont help much
11/01/2021, 8:11 am - Athira CEA: Define ‘need’ pls
11/01/2021, 8:12 am - Athira CEA: So wud that mean I wud have to delete both the apps from my phone now?
11/01/2021, 8:14 am - Athira CEA: I don’t remember .... and am not sure if I did or did not accept the terms..... how can i heck that?( sorry for bombarding u with these naive questions
11/01/2021, 8:15 am - Athira CEA: * check
11/01/2021, 8:22 am - +91 80890 89031: mmm... how do you define "need" ... 🤔 for me its derived from a feeling- if I am not at peace with something then I dont agree to it. So, if in your assessment if youre not feeling comfortable about something..
11/01/2021, 8:22 am - +91 80890 89031: https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/updates/privacy-policy/?lang=en
11/01/2021, 8:22 am - +91 80890 89031: this may help.
11/01/2021, 8:24 am - +91 80890 89031: mm... not necessarily. you don't need to do it unless there is an immediate need for it. you can always do it when you need it.
11/01/2021, 8:28 am - Athira CEA: 🤔hmmm... no such discomforts.... I am not much active in FB... I do check it regularly... but do not upload or comment... just a peek-aa-boo into what others have posted... a sort of silent watcher... have not been uploading any pics or events since past 2 years...does that sound ok-ok,Vivek?
11/01/2021, 8:28 am - Athira CEA: 👍thanks ...
11/01/2021, 8:28 am - Athira CEA: Okay... that sounds pretty comforting 😅

11/01/2021, 8:32 am - +91 80890 89031: FB also tracks your movements when youre not logged in. they wont however accept this. but then many of the other apps can also do this. some of the apps may also spy on you- you never really know if some one is listening to you or watching you through your camera. there was a cyber security expert who did a video on this a few years ago. so while there is no need to be so scared about this, we need to pretty much use all devices as an intruder into our lives.
11/01/2021, 8:33 am - +91 80890 89031: this is the reason why people by Apple devices... the level of security nd privacy for you is much higher than other devices in the market.

11/01/2021, 8:35 am - +91 80890 89031: ha ha ha - dont ask me all the questions- i dont know all the answers- however, Apple is way more secure...
11/01/2021, 8:35 am - +91 80890 89031: my mac tells me that in the last 7 days it stopped 127 trackers from profiling me....
11/01/2021, 8:39 am - +91 80890 89031: the internet universe is quite different from the one that we see everyday. the rules are different. remember, once something is on the net, it can never really be deleted. there was a fight about setting up deleting something form th internet permanently as one's basic birth right. but don't know if it will work.
11/01/2021, 8:40 am - Athira CEA: Ohhhkayyy..... sort of calm now.... even the other devices we use are of Apple... so okay-okay !

11/01/2021, 8:45 am - +91 80890 89031: ha ha ha - its just like HR... you try to bring the best out of people and love them a lot. (remember, if the HR you have experienced is NOT like that, then I am sorry- HR's job is to bring the best out of you and help you navigate the worst in you).
11/01/2021, 8:46 am - +91 80890 89031: thank you!!! Now that is professional advice.
11/01/2021, 8:47 am - Athira CEA: Very well explained dear.... thanks a lot.... will be more cautious 😊

11/01/2021, 9:43 am - Athira CEA: 🥶( nervous laugh)
11/01/2021, 9:45 am - Athira CEA: Hey BTW Vivek, I have been meaning to ask you.... are u in contact with Krishna or Sarath Geevargheae( Ur St.Thomas classmates and our common batchmates at Achamma teacher’s tuition class)?They were both my schoolmates until 5 th Grade in HolyAngels’
11/01/2021, 9:50 am - +91 80890 89031: yes.. i do talk to both of them. meet up with them once in a while. We are also in the same WAG so thats where most of the communications happen.
11/01/2021, 9:50 am - +91 80890 89031: I am assuming that youre refering to Krishna of the PRS group
11/01/2021, 9:52 am - Athira CEA: Her aunt is Dr.Aanandam. Krishna is married to George ( ur classmate)
11/01/2021, 9:52 am - +91 80890 89031: Yup the same...

13/01/2021, 7:47 am - SijeshP: Ordering a Pizza in 2022 

CALLER: Is this Pizza Hut? 

GOOGLE: No sir, it's Google Pizza. 

CALLER: I must have dialed a wrong number, sorry. 

GOOGLE: No sir, Google bought Pizza Hut last month. 

CALLER: OK. I would like to order a pizza.

GOOGLE: Do you want your usual, sir? 

CALLER: My usual? You know me?

GOOGLE: According to your caller ID data sheet, the last 12 times you called you ordered an extra-large pizza with three cheeses, sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms and meatballs on a thick crust. 

CALLER: Super! That's what I'll have. 

GOOGLE: May I suggest that this time you order a pizza with ricotta, arugula, sun-dried tomatoes and olives on a whole wheat gluten-free thin crust? 

CALLER: What? I don't want a vegetarian pizza! 

GOOGLE: Your cholesterol is not good, sir.

CALLER: How the hell do you know that? 

GOOGLE: Well, we cross-referenced your home phone number with your medical records. We have the result of your blood tests for the last 7 years.

CALLER: Okay, but I do not want your rotten vegetarian pizza! I already take medication for my cholesterol. 

GOOGLE: Excuse me sir, but you have not taken your medication regularly. According to our database, you purchased only a box of 30 cholesterol tablets once at Lloyds Pharmacy, 4 months ago. 

CALLER: I bought more from another Pharmacy. 

GOOGLE: That doesn't show on your credit card statement. 

CALLER: I paid in cash.

GOOGLE: But you did not withdraw enough cash according to your bank statement. 

CALLER: I have other sources of cash. 

GOOGLE: That doesn't show on your latest tax returns, unless you bought them using an undeclared income source, which is against the law! 

CALLER: WHAT THE HELL!

CALLER: Enough already! I'm sick to death of Google, Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp and all the others. I'm going to an island without the internet, TV, where there is no phone service and no one to watch me or spy on me. 

GOOGLE: I understand sir, but you need to renew your passport first. It expired 6 weeks ago.

So not surprised with the pigeon news. They strictly are against raw vegetables, meat and poultry products being brought to Australia.. especially Adelaide regions. Visa also could get revoked if you are found carrying bio-risk stuffs 😇

18/01/2021, 11:28 am - Rahul Engg: ..wow.. great.. 👍👍
18/01/2021, 11:52 am - Devi CEA: I'm reserving my thoughts here 😂😂 ...hard but I'm trying, .... am going to be thankful for the small blessings for Peace☺️😇......if I share this good news with Any Bangalorean they could roast me with a cold stare...such is the frustration over the  infra mess In the IT hub.....Now need to figure if we need to be air dropped into the train .. fear of traffic jams post covid is real...ayyo...I don't want to sound any more negative on a good Monday.......but good share......🙏🌼
18/01/2021, 11:54 am - Devi CEA: This is a regular train....by the way...

.a normal cab drop to the airport is 1000rs....

So 10 rs is a steal ...unbelievable too..
18/01/2021, 12:03 pm - Devi CEA: The metro is being built to the airport currently ....this will connect electronics city , all the major tech parks to the airport.. ...planned for 2023 I believe..
18/01/2021, 12:11 pm - Umesh CEA: can understand the frustration
18/01/2021, 12:13 pm - Umesh CEA: Hyderabad as well this is an issue..they did not start yet mentioning security issue if direct to airport..did not understand the logic..if metro starts will impact the cab's very much..could be the issue
18/01/2021, 12:20 pm - Devi CEA: I think the clearance to the airport would be handled starting some x metro point...then the line would be exclusive to airport with min stops ... Delhi metro is quite seamless for airport transfer....just admire how well kept those stations are
.....but things are picking up...lots of pressure from tax paying residents .
18/01/2021, 12:30 pm - Umesh CEA: true..heard about Delhi.. not experienced it.
18/01/2021, 1:22 pm - GT Australia: Delhi metro will take you into check in area

25/01/2021, 9:49 am - Devi CEA: Maachu kalayanda pls...I am glad you noticed a particular trait of her rendering..She has done a fabulous job , ..I feel many artists try to emulate some lasting drama in their execution so  that the experience becomes special....in the first para the landing notes were finished abruptly  esp last words..painkili alle...pookani alle....so the abruptness is unique here...but in second stanza where you need abrupt ending(pularnnu pularnnu thelinju yhelinju) she used continuum which is also unique.....we can call it inconsistency or novelty......but good observation..

25/01/2021, 4:36 pm - Devi CEA: Poetry certainly is lost, agree...but I think the instrumentals are picking up because the main audience is also middle aged 35 to 50 something's mostly....so they choose songs that trigger nostalgia...my dad doesnt hear instrumentals...he prefers original singers ..for eg..

Officially we are all old..😁..

27/01/2021, 9:59 am - Umesh CEA: 😊😊...No one will have complains with Apple though...good at least they started manufacturing in India..work in progress to get even more manufacturing parts in India..though so expensive still cannot imagine so many people buying it.
27/01/2021, 10:50 am - Devi CEA: My brains pops out when the western janta, specifically American whites,  look at me in conversations with a lot of empathy and say..."I understand your country has soo much poverty'...
I'll keep nodding with a zillion images in my mind....
It's soo hard to explain...the diversity you see is exciting and with unimaginable possibilities .They will never believe a house help working for say 2$/hr enters the house and asks for the wifi password immediately....😂...
to what you said .India is a Young country resplendent with age old wisdom....here everything will thrive as long as our  aspirational nature as a country holds..also the working population share is larger than non working population, ...with median age of about 30 I've read...Hence for companies that makes products catering to a fairly young psyche it's a kill.....happy for Apple..they have quality no doubt.
27/01/2021, 11:00 am - Devi CEA: I so hope the distribution of wealth in india becomes fair one day....dont get me wrong, what I wrote is mostly for the urban parts ..rural is a different story.......But I just wanted to comment on the ignorance I've seen generally about how we live and what we are...and then huge companies hitting gold when times are bad.......☺️
27/01/2021, 11:02 am - Umesh CEA: this is so true..rural india is catching up..they have video conference meetings nowadays...wifi connectivity being setup..will change in few years time..but yes wealth distribution...it is tough to get that almost equally
27/01/2021, 11:06 am - Umesh CEA: 2$/per hour and asks for wifi password 😊😊
27/01/2021, 11:08 am - Umesh CEA: the entrepreneurs in us waiting to hatch...1 rupee each of 130 crore even 50 crore just imagine..the newspapers for example..nowadays it is around 10 rupees..10 lakh people daily paying 10 rupees..I cant imagine 😊
27/01/2021, 11:21 am - Devi CEA: Could be even 2$/day for some ketto...depends urban it rural.....but yeah wifi password is a reality my maid hops between 3 homes and can only speak kannada...now she reads English too .......everyone's doomed...😁

This week the highlight for me was Chitra getting the Padma Bhushan and we having lived to experience her singing, her accolades and humble presence..
The number of songs that play out thinking of Chitra..My god , too many, at all stages of life we have our favourites right?!!..
Out of so many my peculiar favourite is this one song  particularly for her cheerful and coy singing style .Shes this cute cuddly bundle on stage and with all humility performed a romantic sensual number with aplomb and childlike innocence.....
29/01/2021, 6:06 pm - Devi CEA: https://youtu.be/xLXz8I29aKg 

Maaleyam...Maarodalinju....She's sings live and as good as recording.....
29/01/2021, 6:07 pm - Devi CEA: Enjoy Your evening...guys...pinne oralpam Kathi koodi....

29/01/2021, 6:12 pm - Athira CEA: Unique blend of sensual melody with bold jathis....
29/01/2021, 6:12 pm - Devi CEA: Such a beautiful composition I feel......Based on raaga Mohana Kalyani, its possibly experimental because this formulation was soo unheard at time.....  Sharath's orchestration patterns is so unique it often steals the show from the singer,...But kali Chitrayude aduthu nadannila...😁 His arrangement, so novel , hard to believe its a 90s song .Do closely listen to  elements of jazz fusion ......too..Violinist Francis is also there.....he's there everywhere..😁
29/01/2021, 6:13 pm - Devi CEA: Yes rhythm is also off beat...literally off beat....
29/01/2021, 6:15 pm - Devi CEA: To Aneesh....at 2:34 chitra puts additional sangathis..beautifully..the expression after that of a proud student..😉
29/01/2021, 6:16 pm - Athira CEA: 😀😀Aneesh saarrr
29/01/2021, 6:16 pm - Devi CEA: guys.......Do send in your favourite chitra number, maybe just one if you may so that we dont overwhelm people...would love to understand what song touched you the most...its soo nice to understand everyones taste , so unique to everyone..  cummon....
29/01/2021, 6:18 pm - Devi CEA: This message was deleted
29/01/2021, 6:19 pm - Devi CEA: Infact Shareth songs have complicated sangathis mostly...   It was cute to see chitra put some extra sangathi that was not part of the initial track.......

Oru nalla weekend with so many Chitra songs....however a week does not do justice to her....alle..
She teaches a profound lesson on humility and giving back to society...her foundation does amazing work and her discipline and grounded nature inspires so many ..thanks for the shares guys...
31/01/2021, 7:19 pm - Devi CEA: Some of these shares may be overwhelming to less interested, understand that...and to many it's also a welcome relief. Our interests do vary....actually njangal kuraChu per formil ethiyilla😁..ithonnum alla avastha!!!...tried being modest......but the purpose is solely for engagement within the group...I would encourage people to come forward with their ideas of engagement too, that would be constructive......many of us really don't want to repeat the  pattern of disengaged interaction ( eg: the 4 yrs we were together)....so let's try in ways we know......

01/02/2021, 9:54 am - Rahul Engg: പഞ്ചസാര കഴിച്ചില്ലെങ്കിൽ കാൻസർ പടരില്ല എന്ന ആദ്യ പോയിന്റ്‌. പഞ്ചസാര ആയാലും ചോറായാലും ചപ്പാത്തിയായാലും കാർബോഹൈഡ്രേറ്റ് വിഭാഗത്തിലെ എന്ത് സാധനമായാലും ശരീരത്തിലെത്തിയാൽ ഒടുക്കം ഗ്ലൂക്കോസായി മാറും. ശരീരത്തിന്റെ സകലപ്രവർത്തനങ്ങൾക്കുമുള്ള ഇന്ധനമാണ്‌ ഗ്ലൂക്കോസ്‌. ആമാശയത്തിലെത്തുമ്പോൾ പഞ്ചസാരത്തരി പെറുക്കിയെടുത്ത്‌ 'ഹായ്‌ നമുക്ക്‌ കാൻസറിന്‌ തിന്നാൻ കൊടുക്കാം' എന്ന്‌ തീരുമാനിക്കാനുള്ള മെക്കാനിസം അവിടെയില്ല. അസംബന്ധമാണിത്‌. പഞ്ചസാര കഴിക്കാതിരുന്നാൽ കാൻസർ തടയാനാവില്ല...

01/02/2021, 10:08 am - Rahul Engg: For eg. One man with low sugar problem may use sugar as a medicine.. 😀
01/02/2021, 10:08 am - Rahul Engg: ..more lemon also a poison.. lead to kidney stones..

01/02/2021, 10:15 am - Devi CEA: Ayyo that is a bit of a situation Rahul ....low sugar can lead to Blackout....monitoring sugar levels especially at night is key......
01/02/2021, 10:17 am - Devi CEA: But there is hope.. pls ask her to do regular excercises and have her meals at the right time...if possible ...breaking the pattern of 3 meals to maybe 5...but yes this can be regulated....don't worry ok .
01/02/2021, 10:21 am - Devi CEA: Im curently not having it but diabetes I've managed at home ..both hyper and hypo....glycemia.......it's tricky sometimes.....well chat....
01/02/2021, 10:36 am - Athira CEA: 😂 sugar-“ Haaii! Namukku cancernu thinnaan kodukkaam”...👌...😂
.... on a serious note ...Cancer cells usually grow quickly, multiplying at a fast rate, which takes a lot of energy. This means they need lots of glucose.
That may be because there is an indirect link between cancer risk and sugar. Eating lots of sugar over time can cause us to gain weight, and robust scientific evidence shows that being overweight 🥴 increases the risk of almost 13 ( if my memory serves right from what I read in an article)different types of cancer.
01/02/2021, 11:01 am - Rahul Engg: ..hmm.. feeding sugar sufficiently.. 😉

07/02/2021, 10:21 am - Devi CEA: I thInk they stretched it a bit too far to get the point across...script felt a bit cheesy, tacky ... some situations and acting were realistic but you can feel the trying tooo hard bit...
07/02/2021, 10:22 am - Devi CEA: All scenes not suitable for kids...but definitely😂 needs to be seen with husband and FIL...but don't quote this movie. ...It lacks on many fronts
07/02/2021, 10:23 am - Devi CEA: Daily motion ..it has 2 parts..
07/02/2021, 10:27 am - Athira CEA: I suppose it felt a bit stretchy, as the Director would have wanted the viewers to realize how monotonous and tiring is the work in the kitchen.A school mate of mine who watched the movie said that a remarkable thing about the movie is that both the men are not portrayed as angry or violent characters, but as soft-spoken ones who calmly impose their will on the woman, like slow, sweet poison. 😄

07/02/2021, 10:28 am - Athira CEA: Oh ! Is it? 😍😍nokkatte
07/02/2021, 10:34 am - Devi CEA: Yes the topic of being privileged in silence in patriarchy  , automatic benefactors of an existential system etc...But yes for those sensitive and reactive to social "dictation topics.....I would say give it a miss.....Can ruffle feathers a bit....

there is a scene where a clogged drain represents "the how much should or can you take of any situation "...but in the movie was misplaced in the script to route discussion to all other directions....anyway one time watch sadly for a pressing concern in society.
07/02/2021, 10:44 am - Athira CEA: True...
07/02/2021, 10:45 am - Athira CEA: I happened to watch a lot of trailers of the film that is a rage now in You tube.There is this recurring shot in the film...the hands of women as they cook, grind, clean, wipe, sweep. It may seem repetitive but it is as if Jeo Baby wants the viewer to feel the exhaustion of that endless cycle.🤪There is no background score either, alle?...what can be heard is the sound of women's work that punctuates the air as the men go about their self-important 😀. Mikka veedukalilum ithaavaam sthithi.. pakshe ellaa  veedukalil anganeyum alla ketto.The GIK , I feel.., ithuvare kandilla....is different from the average film on unhappy marriages. There is no overt domestic violence, the issues are not a matter of life and death. Yet, they r ultimately, issues that drain the life out of women, inch by inch.alle?
07/02/2021, 10:50 am - Devi CEA: The society...itself will take a torturous stand on YouTube....ayyo..

Felt:
The consequence of 'time' is soo different for each character in the movie....that was good.....also more than chores  shown in the movie , the lack of communication between people is a parallel thread......sadly that thread was also left loose somewhere,  passive aggressive dealing with problems seemed to be the heroines stand ...could not agree on that....nee enthayalum watch with a clear mind and clear your mind after watching.😂😁

09/02/2021, 6:06 am - Umesh CEA: not seen Tappad..but had seen Pink..I liked that..but stopped watching Bollywood movies except self made people after SSR case..I hate to pay money and see these guys now

09/02/2021, 6:26 am - Devi CEA: The most poignant message in Pink was...
"We all take care of our girls, but who takes care of our boys".

We must accept that gone are the days when men went out to the paddy fields or out hunting for meat, while women stayed back to take care of the belongings, kids and elderly, cook etc…our ways of living have changed. No disrespect to men or women… sometimes its just the way it is, because it has always been like that and no one has stopped to think… bottom line, if you want a change its starts in your home.. Like Umesh said, when you live outside as many of us are in nuclear families, the automatic right thing is to co share the responsibilities and complement each other… If there is a piece of work that is not that enjoyable and there is someone already doing it, human instinct is to stay back and let the person continue doing it, perhaps even oblivious to burden of the task…This goes for both men and women…..  say if you were driving Bangalore to TVM, would you take turns to drive with your husband/wife or let the same person do it back and forth? Is it always the same person cooking meals and cleaning dishes or do you take turns with your husband/wife? 
As adults, I think we have settled in for a lifestyle that suits us (some more than the others😜), but we need to consciously think what we are modelling to our kids… your son/daughter may get married to someone who expects shared working and shared responsibilities in the house… are you equipping them for it? Next time you fix the tap, ask your daughter to try it with a spanner, next time you cook, ask your son to wash/cut veggies for you… empower them, let them understand that they can and should be able to do everything….we don’t have to cling on to clichés😊
10/02/2021, 7:30 am - Devi CEA: You spoke my mind..👍👍Thanks for opening up. I have always quoted the example of koottukudumbam and how a good number of women in various age groups ran the kitchen show in earlier times..it was necessary and practical for the times, but have we pondered how this will now play in a single woman kitchen (mostly the case now and in some houses the menu is quite simmilar) .......I feel it's  only practical that we consolidate effort as a Family to spend and share THE most precious thing amongst our loved ones  ie....TIME, something we can never get back..
so , share the responsibility of living in harmony, .. develop our kids to be better humanbeings, give focussed and mindful support to our spouses and all our support groups and not forgetting  our own physical and mental health....

BEing there in love and support will make our journey together  meaningful...that's the practicality we as educated people need to stand by for ourselves and society.....Thanks Teenz...
10/02/2021, 7:36 am - Devi CEA: I also know many men who own the responsibilities, who teach their sons

11/02/2021, 12:32 pm - Umesh CEA: This remarkable painting is by Ajunath Sindhu Vinalay, a 9th Std boy in Thrissur, Kerala. Tired of hearing that his mother doesn't work, he painted her doing her various chores. His impressed teacher sent it to the Govt and it’s now the cover for the State’s 2020/21 gender document. #art #empowerment

My wife, my grandma, my aunt, friends etc.. the most influential person is my mom as she set the basic character within me and my attitude towards life. Being a teacher, she was amazing in managing household work, our education etc along with her official workload. Everyday i see her getting  up at 4 AM in the morning to finish house work and teach us before going to school at 7.30..

25/03/2021, 5:36 pm - Devi CEA: Small, Hima...ningalude okke plans enthaaanu for this year....July or December....any chances..
25/03/2021, 5:45 pm - Devi CEA: From first looks, 6/10 out station people have expressed doubts about 2021 travel plans...hence we could perhaps meet each other in small groups ..but a larger reunion is quite subject to travel relaxation around the world.....So

1. Should we already push the larger reunion to 2022.
2. Can we still have the india folks meet up for small subset reunion in December/August since 2021 marks 20yrs and we still do something  small in consideration??..Anyone travelling around that time can still join
25/03/2021, 5:48 pm - Devi CEA: 3. District chapter reunion-for eg Trivandrum Chapter Quick one day at a resort or Hotel

Luxy, Vivek, Devi, Femina, Athira, Renu, Reshmi, Rahul, Mangal ....and anyone willing to travel to Trivandrum...
25/03/2021, 5:48 pm - Devi CEA: Thoughts guys...
25/03/2021, 5:52 pm - Devi CEA: Although I must say the most active ones in our group are NRIs by activity...but we in India are also quite a sizeable number...So how many of us are game for any get together that we can manage amongst people here......???....just thoughts of what can be done...☺️
25/03/2021, 6:05 pm - Femina: Devi, i think rather than districtwise... Everyone in kerala can meet one day.. also whoever can come
25/03/2021, 6:11 pm - Devi CEA: Certainly da..for eg sake I took a quick head count for TVM and got 9 people  who could manage something ...that's all....surely if it's Ekm for some it means closer to home and for others it's travel....
25/03/2021, 8:30 pm - +971 50 920 3301: Tvm is good for me if I m in Kerala,  I think only GT and Sijesh if they are in Kerala then will find it far ..
26/03/2021, 10:10 am - Athira CEA: Heard and saw about the heavy rain and near-to-cyclone condition in Kochi.....Hope all who are in Kochi are safe.

02/04/2021, 1:05 pm - Deepu CEA: സത്യസന്ധമായ ഒരു കഥ.. 😊
👇👇👇

കടയുടമ പുറത്തേക്കിറങ്ങിയ സമയം ഒരു ഭ്രാന്തൻ ഓടി വന്ന് ആ മൊബൈൽ ഷോപ്പിൽ കയറി ഒരു വിലകൂടിയ ഫോൺ മോഷ്ടിച്ചു ..

അതേസമയം പുറത്ത് പോയ കട ഉടമ പെട്ടന്ന് തന്നെ കടയിലേക്ക് വരുകയും ആ ഭ്രാന്തനെ കയ്യോടെ പിടിയ്ക്കുകയും ചെയ്തു.

എന്നാൽ കള്ളൻ നോർമലല്ല ഭ്രാന്തനാണെന്ന് അയാൾ മനസ്സിലാക്കി. അതിനാൽ പോലീസിനെ വിളിച്ചില്ല.

ഈ ഭ്രാന്തൻ ഇത്രയും വിലയേറിയ
ഫോൺ എങ്ങനെ ഉപയോഗിക്കും?
ഇവന് ഇതിനെക്കുറിച്ച് എന്തെങ്കിലും അറിയുമൊ
ഇല്ലയോ എന്ന് നോക്കാം.
അയാൾക്ക് കൗതുകമായി.

നീ ഈ ഫോൺ പ്രവർത്തിപ്പിച്ചു കാണിയ്ക്കാമെങ്കിൽ നിന്നെ വിട്ടയക്കാം. അല്ലെങ്കിൽ പോലീസിനെ വിളിക്കും. അയാൾ ആ മനുഷ്യനോട് പറഞ്ഞു.

കയ്യിലുള്ള ഫോണിൽ
അവൻ വളരെ സന്തോഷവാനായിരുന്നു. ചിരിച്ചു കൊണ്ട് അയാൾ മൊബൈൽ സ്ക്രീനിൽ സ്പർശിച്ചു ..

പക്ഷെ ഫോണിൽ ഒന്നും സംഭവിച്ചില്ല.

അയാൾ വീണ്ടും
സ്‌ക്രീനിൽ തൊട്ടു..
അപ്പോഴും ഒന്നും സംഭവിച്ചില്ല..

വീണ്ടും തൊട്ടു.. *See more*

03/04/2021, 6:45 pm - Devi CEA: ☺️..since a larger reunion may not be feasible this year, suggested we then atleast try to meet in smaller groups..Tvm and kochi has somewhat equal number of people I'm guessing , so two gettos maybe ...although that's not much fun atleast we do something.......it's still very open Deepu.....
03/04/2021, 6:50 pm - Devi CEA: Another thinking is why don't we declare a location somewhere in middle like Vembanad, Aleppey, Kollam... Some really good resort , and have all people join instead of splitting up....monsoon would be perfect for this , or somewhere around December.....however 🙄With the numbers rising and vaccines pending we really have to wait and watch...
03/04/2021, 6:57 pm - Devi CEA: 2021 is what our nri friends can plan......but everything hangs on our uninvited guest..😏.....in Bangalore in my apartment 10 houses reported positive last two days...this current strain is spreading fast...stay safe guys...

04/04/2021, 12:13 pm - Athira CEA: Yes yes.... very true... as Easter is the culmination of 40 days of fasting and penitence, it is only fair😀that the feast is one of grand indulgence.Though I feel that the brief dalliance with vegetarianism( which I can barely do even when I try doing it for the nine days of Navaratri), would be quite spiritually uplifting.I remember my neighbour( Teresa aunty) would cook chicken kurma with its profusion of fresh greens and succulent chicken( slurrrrrrp🤤)with soft melt-in-the-mouth idlis.... for breakfast and invite me over.So yes! As Devi said,photos from sumptuous breakfasts and lunches and dinner are most welcome( promise.... ningalkku vayaru vedana varuthaathe kothi vittollaam)

God gave u twins because ,ur intense fatherly love was too vast to be absorbed by just one adorable daughter( Parumol)🥰.Forget all the happy memories of the life that you have had so far. As compared to being parents to twins, nothing comes at par. Congratulations to You,Prami and Paroose.😀

..I cut my vein and tell you Vivek..😂😂..nobody is gonna send you a song recording...maybe Umesh might, Athira might, ansha might...ragi might...so dedication may work better
..what say..you and I have..now let's say everyone wakes up
19/04/2021, 8:58 pm - Devi CEA: And this time can we dedicate songs for people outside our close circle...hmmm...what say...??

- Stay away from all external engagements that can be avoided.
- Try to wear a surgical mask over your existing mask, the blue one you get in the pharmacy..
Double masking is recommended now.
- Arrange to take the vaccine shot at the earliest, from May 1

Take care and hope all families are safe...👍👍

23/04/2021, 6:48 am - Ratheesh Kamu: What the hell is this? This is the second time in 2 days.. Why are human lives so cheap in our country? 😡😡
23/04/2021, 6:49 am - Rahul Engg: In Bhopal, 350 people returned home from Hospital after becoming healthy yesterday, 2120 people returned home after becoming healthy in Mumbai. Today 1895 people returned home healthy in Delhi, 465 people returned home today in Lucknow. 5341 in Kerala.... Everywhere most of the public is returning home healthy,hale & happy  everyone is requested to spread such messages & positivity. 

Today, 1,22,839 people recovered and returned home all over India. Share happiness, not fear. .💪
23/04/2021, 6:51 am - Devi CEA: Yes, it's a reality and things are not soo good...Hard to keep a positive mind frame nowadays, although we need to persist, we at home only put the news once a day at night to avoid this continuous loop of bad news..The world is soo different now alle, better be prepared than sorry...
23/04/2021, 6:57 am - Devi CEA: Yes another way is to put yourself to service without direct contact. I spoke with a panchayat member about what can be done ...after 28th I'm thinking of helping with coWin registrations..support and help will be the soft positive touch everyone needs..
23/04/2021, 7:02 am - Devi CEA: Guys keep your immunity up 
-Vit c tabs daily
-Turmeric milk with tulsi or jeera or garlic(based on taste)...at night for everyone at home who have no preconditions.
23/04/2021, 7:02 am - Ratheesh Kamu: Its soo frustrating, Devi.. These are all man made disasters which could be avoided .These people dont do proper maintenance of the equipment and all the budget would have gone to their pockets and bank accounts. Innocent people without knowing anything become victims of our corrupt system..😞😞
23/04/2021, 7:10 am - +91 94462 26739: Well said Rahul. Be positive..👌👍💪
23/04/2021, 7:14 am - Devi CEA: Very true Ratheesh...I am with you... myself am soo frustrated that in this era I am unable to procure a vaccine of my choice here. 
Monopolisation of Indian vaccine seems to be more important than letting people who can have it, have it early enough..I so wish a pfizer was available here.
The first lack of foresight was that the vaccine was limited for 45+ . The moving crowd who uses public transport is mostly 20-45 , the 45+ are more settled into their private vehicles and seniors into  retirement life...they were less mobile if you think of it..So in hindsight both sides of the age spectrum should have been handled simultaneously so that an average coverage of vaccinated population was possible...now I am sure May 1st will be mayhem...Neither have they closed the 45+ group, so now you'll have the young and old fighting for slots

Anyway we have to work around with the good and bad....and persist.
23/04/2021, 7:22 am - Devi CEA: I beg to differ 😊. I understand why you said that Aneesh.What Ratheesh sent was just info and he expressed what he felt, certainly not intended to spread negativity.

In this situation we cannot clean everything under the carpet and think everything is ok.
Such news should help us be more cautious, that's all..I'm sure everyone in this group knows how to internalise such news.
 Better to be informed and work every day to stay positive in our own ways.

Infact atleast some engagement in this group makes me positive everyday..silence does not...👍👍Let us allow people to express ..anyday....we always have a choice to ignore what we don't want to consume
23/04/2021, 7:30 am - GT Australia: I can understand the political undercurrent in these responses..  lack of responsibility on part of administration claiming innocent lives is the last reason why one should connect politics at here
23/04/2021, 7:32 am - GT Australia: Be it MH, KL or GJ people's life matter.
23/04/2021, 7:35 am - GT Australia: Positivity is good, but let all the hospital, management think of safety of staffs, patients, learn something from this sad incident.
23/04/2021, 7:39 am - +91 94462 26739: No devi..you misunderstood me.😢😢 I read this msg just after the morning news paper.😟😟 I emphasis ed and agreed to the only one with some positive news...nothing beyond.. love you all...😊😊😊💕 I have no conflict with Ratheesh or any of my family members here...😊😊😊
23/04/2021, 7:48 am - Devi CEA: Hugggs for that..I understand u better now..🤗...the best we can do is allow people to express and Be there for them In empathy..it's so tough to be away from parents, siblings...alle..and then to hear of these incidents in India..tough...

BEing there ..being available in spirit and mind for both the Lows and the Highs of each one of us.

23/04/2021, 1:00 pm - Devi CEA: Tks for sending this..
Infact having a date helps us better..because you are not falsely hoping that things will get better soon or this year,  and putting off things for later, rather you accept this is the grim reality as the present and how do we adapt to this new world with new dimensions to live a healthy life. You will then continue doing what you needed to do instead of putting it off for a better day..accepting this is the new normal

I really feel bad for children ..their childhood and what could have been... homeschooling is the way forward...
23/04/2021, 1:05 pm - +971 50 920 3301: Yes, I think children will be affected the most in terms of their emotional and social well being
23/04/2021, 5:33 pm - Ratheesh Kamu: Yeah,true .. They could have made different kinds of vaccines available for us to choose. Monopolisation is not going to help us at all..
Central and state govts also might be learning big lessons in the process. Nobody would have faced a disaster of this scale in their life time and itd be continuous learning for all.. I hope people cooperate with the govts,  put our lives above politics and help the govt to help us..
23/04/2021, 5:34 pm - Ratheesh Kamu: Really👍 Truly wish they learn!

25/04/2021, 11:15 am - +91 94462 26739: (നിർബന്ധമായും വായിക്കുക. കൂട്ടുകാർക്ക് എത്തിക്കുക)

*കൊറോണ എല്ലാവർക്കുമായി സംഭവിക്കാൻ പോകുന്നു എന്ന പൊതു ബോധം രൂപപ്പെടുന്നു..*

യുഎസിൽ ഒരു തടവുകാരനെ വധശിക്ഷയ്ക്ക് വിധിച്ചു, ചില ശാസ്ത്രജ്ഞർ ഈ തടവുകാരനെക്കുറിച്ച് ഒരു പരീക്ഷണം നടത്തണമെന്ന് കരുതി. 

തൂക്കിക്കൊല്ലുന്നതിനുപകരം വിഷം കലർന്ന കൊബ്രയുടെ കടിയാൽ കൊല്ലപ്പെടുമെന്ന് തടവുകാരനോട് പറഞ്ഞു:
 
ഒരു സർപ്പത്തെ അവന്റെ മുന്നിൽ കൊണ്ടുവന്നു, അവർ തടവുകാരന്റെ കണ്ണുകൾ അടച്ച് ഒരു കസേരയിൽ കെട്ടി. 

ഒരേ സമയം രണ്ട് സേഫ്റ്റി പിൻ കൊണ്ട് ചെറുതായൊന്ന് കുത്തി. രണ്ട് സെക്കൻഡിനുള്ളിൽ തടവുകാരൻ മരിച്ചു. 

(സർപ്പത്തെ അവന്റെ മുൻപിൽ മാത്രമേ കൊണ്ടുവന്നിട്ടുള്ളൂ - അത് അവനെ സ്പർശിച്ചില്ല)

തടവുകാരന്റെ ശരീരത്തിൽ പാമ്പിന്റെ വിഷത്തിന് സമാനമായ വിഷം അടങ്ങിയിട്ടുണ്ടെന്ന് പോസ്റ്റ്‌മോർട്ടം വെളിപ്പെടുത്തി.

ഇപ്പോൾ ഈ വിഷം എവിടെ നിന്ന് വന്നു, അല്ലെങ്കിൽ തടവുകാരന്റെ മരണത്തിന് കാരണമായത് എന്താണ്?

വിഷം അവന്റെ മാനസിക ശരീരത്തിലൂടെയുള്ള സ്വന്തം ശരീരത്തിലൂടെയാണ് നിർമ്മിച്ചത്!

നിങ്ങൾ എടുക്കുന്ന ഓരോ തീരുമാനവും പോസിറ്റീവ് അല്ലെങ്കിൽ നെഗറ്റീവ് എനർജി ഉൽപാദിപ്പിക്കുകയും അതിനനുസരിച്ച് നിങ്ങളുടെ ശരീരം ഹോർമോണുകൾ ഉത്പാദിപ്പിക്കുകയും ചെയ്യുന്നു.

90% രോഗങ്ങൾക്കും മൂലകാരണം നെഗറ്റീവ് ചിന്തകൾ സൃഷ്ടിക്കുന്ന energy (-) ഊർജ്ജമാണ്.

ഇന്ന് മനുഷ്യൻ തന്റെ തെറ്റായ ചിന്തകളാൽ ക്ഷമിക്കാത്ത സ്വഭാവത്താൽ സ്വയം കത്തിക്കുകയും സ്വയം നശിപ്പിക്കുകയും ചെയ്യുന്നു
 
കൊറോണയുടെ സ്ഥിതിവിവരക്കണക്കുകൾ പരിശോധിക്കരുത്, കാരണം 90% ത്തിലധികം ആളുകൾ സുഖമായിരിക്കുന്നു, മാത്രമല്ല മരണങ്ങൾ കൊറോണ രോഗം മൂലമല്ല, അവർക്ക് മറ്റ് അസുഖങ്ങളും ഉണ്ടായിരുന്നു, അതിനാൽ നേരിടാൻ കഴിഞ്ഞില്ല.
 
കൊറോണ കാരണം ആരും വീട്ടിൽ മരിച്ചിട്ടില്ലെന്ന് ഓർമ്മിക്കുക. മരിച്ച എല്ലാ രോഗികളും ആശുപത്രികളിൽ മാത്രമായിരുന്നു.

ആശുപത്രിയിലെ അന്തരീക്ഷവും മനസ്സിലെ ഭയവുമാണ് കാരണം.

പോസിറ്റീവ് ആറ്റിറ്റ്യൂഡുമായി ആശുപത്രിയിൽ പ്രവേശിച്ച കൊറോണ ബാധിച്ചവരെല്ലാം സുഖം പ്രാപിച്ചുവെന്ന് ഓർക്കുക.

*എല്ലായ്പ്പോഴും നിങ്ങളുടെ കാര്യങ്ങൾ പോസിറ്റീവായി നിലനിർത്തൂ..*

 _ഞാൻ എപ്പോഴും രോഗിയാണ് ,_

_എനിക്കു വയ്യ,_
 
_എനിക്ക് കാലു വേദനയാണ്,_
 
_എനിക്ക് വയറുവേദനയാണ്_

എന്ന് ചിന്തിക്കുന്നതിന് പകരം

_ഇന്നു മുതൽ_
 
*ഞാൻ ആരോഗ്യവാനാണ്*

*ഞാൻ സന്തോഷവാനാണ്*

 _എന്ന് നിരന്തരം പറഞ്ഞു നോക്കൂ... 

_അപ്പോൾ അതുപോലെ സംഭവിക്കട്ടെ എന്ന് നിങ്ങളെ അനുഗ്രഹിക്കും._

_മനസ്സിലെ തെറ്റായ ചിന്തയാണ് എല്ലാ രോഗത്തിനും കാരണം_
 *ഒരാഴ്ചയ്ക്കുള്ളിൽ മരിക്കും* എന്ന് ഡോക്ടർമാർ വിധിയെഴുതിയ *സ്റ്റീഫൻ ഹോക്കിംഗ്സ്* വളരെ വർഷങ്ങൾക്കു ശേഷമാണ് മരിച്ചത്. അത് അദ്ദേഹത്തിന്റെ *ആത്മവിശ്വാസം* കൊണ്ടാണ്.

_സൈക്കോളജിക്ക് കുട്ടികളെ പഠിപ്പിക്കുന്ന ഒരു കഥയാണ് നിങ്ങളുമായി പങ്ക് വെക്കുന്നത്._

_അമേരിക്കയിലെ ഒരു യൂണിവേഴ്സിറ്റിയിൽ വെച്ച് ഉച്ചസമയത്ത് ഒരു *കുട്ടി* കുഴഞ്ഞു വീഴുകയും അവനെ ഹോസ്പിറ്റലിൽ എത്തിക്കുകയും ചെയ്തു. വിശദമായ പരിശോധനയിൽ വയറ്റിൽ *വിഷം* എത്തിയിട്ടുണ്ട് എന്ന് മനസ്സിലായി._
 _അബോധാവസ്ഥയിലായ അവനോട് കാര്യങ്ങൾ ചോദിച്ചറിയാൻ കഴിയാത്തതിനാൽ അവൻ അന്ന് കഴിച്ച ഭക്ഷണത്തെ കുറിച്ച് കൂടെ ഉള്ളവരോട് അന്വേഷിച്ചു.._

 _അവൻ പത്തുമണിക്ക് കൂട്ടുകാരുടെ കൂടെ *Burger* കഴിച്ചിരുന്നു എന്നു പറഞ്ഞപ്പോൾ ആ ബർഗറിൽ നിന്നാവും വിഷബാധയേറ്റിട്ടുണ്ടാവുക എന്ന് ചിന്തിച്ച് അനുമാനത്തിൽ എത്തി. എന്നാൽ ഈ വാർത്ത വളരെ പെട്ടെന്ന് കോളേജിൽ വ്യാപിക്കുകയും അന്ന് രാവിലെ ബർഗർ കഴിച്ച പലർക്കും തന്നെ ചർദ്ദിയും കുഴഞ്ഞു വീഴുകയും അബോധാവസ്ഥയിൽ അവുകയും ചെയ്തു. നൂറിലധികം പേർ വൈകുന്നേരമാകുമ്പോഴേക്കും ഹോസ്പിറ്റലിൽ ആവുകയും ചെയ്തു. കൂടാതെ നാലുപേർ അത്യാസന്നനിലയിൽ ആവുകയും രണ്ടു പേർ മരിക്കുകയും ചെയ്തു._

_എന്നാൽ രാത്രി ബോധം വന്നപ്പോഴാണ് ആദ്യം വീണ കുട്ടി പറഞ്ഞത് ബർഗർ കഴിച്ചതുകൊണ്ടല്ല, ഞാൻ *വിഷം കഴിച്ച് ആത്മഹത്യാ ശ്രമം* നടത്തിയതാണെന്ന്._

*അപ്പോൾ നല്ല ബർഗർ കഴിച്ച രണ്ടു പേർ  എങ്ങനെ മരിച്ചു*❓❓

*എങ്ങനെയാണ് ഇത്രയും പേർക്ക് ചർദ്ദി വന്നതും, അബോധാവസ്ഥയിലായതും കൂടാതെ കുറച്ചു പേർ അത്യാസന്ന നിലയിൽ ഹോസ്പിറ്റലിൽ എത്തിയതും* ❓❓

_ഞാൻ കഴിച്ചത് *വിഷമാണ്* എന്ന് ശക്തമായി മനസ്സു പറഞ്ഞാൽ അത് ശരീരത്തെ ബാധിക്കും._

_ആധുനിക ശാസ്ത്രം ഇന്ന്  ഷുഗറിനും മറ്റും പുതിയ അളവുകോലുകൾ കൊണ്ടുവന്നു. യഥാർത്ഥത്തിൽ നിങ്ങൾ ആരോഗ്യവാനാണെങ്കിലും ഇന്ന് നിങ്ങളുടെ രക്തം പരിശോധിച്ചതിനു ശേഷം *പ്രമേഹ രോഗിയാണ്* എന്ന് പ്രഖ്യാപിക്കുമ്പോൾ തന്നെ നിങ്ങളുടെ മനസ്സ് അത് ഏറ്റെടുക്കുകയും അന്നു മുതൽ ഒരു *രോഗിയായി* ജീവിക്കുകയും ചെയ്യുന്നു._

(എല്ലാവർക്കും ഒരേ അളവുകോൽ അല്ല വേണ്ടത് 
പാരമ്പര്യം, ചെയ്യുന്ന ജോലി, സമുദ്രനിരപ്പിൽ നിന്ന് എത്ര ഉയരത്തിലാണ്  താമസം, കഴിക്കുന്ന ഭക്ഷണം, മാനസികാവസ്ഥ എന്നതിനനുസരിച്ച് വ്യത്യാസമുണ്ടാവും. കൂടാതെ ഒരേ ദിവസം വിവിധ സമയങ്ങളിൽ  വിവിധ ലാബിൽ എടുക്കുന്ന ടെസ്റ്റിന്റെ റിസൾട്ടും  ഒന്നാകാത്തതിന്റെ കാര്യവും ഇതു തന്നെ.)

_നല്ല മാനസീകാരോഗ്യമുള്ള ഒരു വ്യക്തിക്ക് നല്ല പ്രതിരോധ ശേഷിയും ആരോഗ്യവും ഉണ്ടാവും._ 

*ശാരീരികവും മാനസികവും ആദ്ധ്യാത്മികവുമായ  സുസ്ഥിരാവസ്ഥയാണ് ആരോഗ്യം എന്ന് ലോകാരോഗ്യ സംഘടന (WHO)*

27/04/2021, 5:32 pm - +91 94460 33603: *Message from Air Marshal Ashutosh Sharma, Chest physician & pulmonologist COMMAND HOSPITAL AIR FORCE, BANGLORE* 
Please send this message to all your colleagues daily.

*Important Message for all* 

The hot water you  
     drink is good for your throat. 

But this Corona   
      virus is hidden behind the 
      Paranasal sinus of your nose for 3 to 4 days. 

The hot water we 
      drink does not reach there. 

After 4 to 5 days  
    this virus that   
    was hidden behind the  
   paranasal sinus reaches your lungs.

 Then you have trouble breathing.

That's why it is very important to take steam, 

which reaches the  
    back of your Paranasal sinus.

 You have to kill this  
   virus in the nose with steam.

At 50°C, this virus becomes disabled i.e. paralyzed. 

At 60°C this virus  
    becomes so weak that any 
     human immunity  
     system can fight against it.

 At 70°C this virus dies completely.

This is what steam does. 

The entire Public    
    Health Department knows this.

 But everyone wants to take   
    advantage of this Pandemic. 

So they don't share this information openly.

One who stays at home should take steam once a day. 

If you go to the market to buy Groceries   
vegetables etc.
 take it twice a day.

 Anyone who meets  
     some people or goes to office
    should take steam 3 times a day.                      

 *Steam week* 

   According to doctors, 
Covid -19 can be killed by 
    inhaling steam from the nose and mouth, 
   eliminating the Coronavirus.  

If all the people  
   started a steam drive campaign for a week, 

the pandemic will soon end. 

So here is a suggestion: 

* Start the process for a week from
morning and evening, for 
  just 5 minutes  
    each time, 
to inhale steam.  
  
If we all adopt this practice for a week  the deadly 

Covid-19 will be erased.

This practice has no side effects & doesn't cost anything either.

  So please send this message to all your Loved Ones, relatives,
    friends and neighbours, 
     so that we all can kill this 
     Corona virus together and live and walk freely
    in this beautiful world.

          *Thank you, jai hind*

20/05/2021, 2:34 pm - Renu CEA: *Some Laws that V didn't learn at school*

01. *LORENZ'S LAW OF MECHANICAL REPAIR*

Once  your hands become coated with grease, your nose will begin to itch.

02. *ANTHONY'S LAW OF THE WORKSHOP*

Any tool, when dropped, will roll to the least accessible corner.

03. *KOVAC'S CONUNDRUM*

When u dial a wrong number, u never get an engaged tone.

04. *CANNON'S KARMIC LAW*

If u tell the boss u were late for work because u had a flat tyre, the next morning u will have a flat tyre.

05 *O'BRIEN'S VARIATION LAW*

If u change queues, the one u have left will start to move faster than the one u are in now.

06. *BELL'S THEOREM*

When the body is immersed in water, the telephone rings.

07. *RUBY'S PRINCIPLE OF CLOSE ENCOUNTERS*

The probability of meeting someone u know increases when u are with someone u don't want to be seen with.

08. *WILLOUGHBY'S LAW*

When u try to prove to someone that a machine won't work, it will.

09. *ZADRA'S LAW OF BIOMECHANICS*

The severity of the itch is inversely proportional to the reach.

10. *BREDA'S RULE*

At any event, the people whose seats are farthest from the aisle arrive last.

11. *OWEN'S LAW*

As soon as u sit down to a cup of hot coffee, your boss will ask u to do something which will last until the coffee is cold...

*Pl keenly observe such actions in your daily life and U may find it ⬆ true*

*Comparisons*

Shweta covered a distance of 10 km in one hour.

Akash covered the same distance in one and a half hours.

Which of the two is faster and healthier??

 Of course our answer will be Shweta.

What if we say that Shweta covered this distance on a prepared track while Akash did it by walking on a sandy path???

Then our answer will be Akash.
 
But when we come to know that Shweta is 50 years old while Akash is 25 years old??

Then our answer will be Shweta again.

But we also come to know that Akash's weight is 140 kg while Shweta's weight us 65 kg.

 Again our answer will be Akash 

As we learn more about Akash and Shweta, our opinions and judgments about who is better will change.
The reality of life is also similar. We form opinions very superficially and hastily, due to which we are not able to do justice to ourselves and others.
 
 Opportunities vary.
 Life is different.
 Resources differ.
 Problems change.
Solutions are different.

Therefore the excellence of life is not in *comparing* with anyone but in testing oneself.

 You are the best. Stay as you are and keep trying your best according to your  circumstances.

 Stay healthy, stay cool, stay satisfied, keep smiling, keep laughing, keep on serving society and the country..

19/06/2021, 9:24 am - Athira CEA: പണ്ടെങ്ങോ കേട്ട് മറന്ന ഒരു കുഞ്ഞ് കഥ ഇന്ന് ഞാൻ വീണ്ടും വായിക്കാനിടയായി.ഇതിൻ്റെ 
സമ്പാദകനും വിവർത്തകനും   ഹഫീദ് നദ്‌വി,കൊച്ചി എന്നാണ് ഇതിൽ കണ്ടത്.
ഈ വായനാ ദിനത്തിൽ ഇന്ന് വായിച്ച ഈ ഒരു കഥ തന്നെ ആയിക്കോട്ടെ ആദ്യം ........

ചിരി വിൽക്കാനുണ്ടോ ചിരി ?!
( അറബിക്കഥ)

  അന്ന് ഒരു തെരുവ് കച്ചവടക്കാരന്റെ ശബ്‌ദം ഞങ്ങൾ താമസിക്കുന്ന സമീപസ്ഥലത്ത് ഉയർന്നുവന്നു

 "സന്തോഷം ...  സൗഭാഗ്യം .. പുഞ്ചിരി ...
 സങ്കടം ...  കണ്ണുനീർ ... വില്ക്കാനുണ്ടോ ?? !! "

ഞാൻ ഉമ്മയുടെ അടുത്തേക്ക് ഓടിച്ചെന്ന് പറഞ്ഞു :
"എനിക്ക് വിൽക്കാൻ  രണ്ട് പഴേ ചിരികളുണ്ടുമ്മാ , കൊടുത്തോട്ടേ "

"നീ എന്താണെന്ന് വെച്ചാ ചെയ്യീം " എന്ന അർദ്ധ സമ്മതത്തിലുള്ള ഉമ്മാന്റെ മൂളൽ.കേട്ടതുപടി വിൽപ്പനക്കാരന്റെ അടുത്ത് ചെന്ന് ചോദിച്ചു:
 
"അങ്കിൾ,  ചിരിക്കെന്താ വില ? "

അയാൾ ഒച്ചയിൽ  തന്നെ മറുപടി നൽകി : 

 "കുട്ടിയുടെ ചിരിയാണെങ്കിൽ ഒരു ദീനാർ ..
ഉപ്പാപ്പമാരുടേതാണെങ്കിൽ ആയിരം വരെ കിട്ടും. പ്രായത്തിനനുസരിച്ച് ചിരിക്ക് വിലമാറും "

ചിരിയുടെ വില വ്യത്യാസത്തിൽ  ആശ്ചര്യപ്പെട്ടുകൊണ്ട് ഞാനയാളോട് ചോദിച്ചു:
 
"അങ്കിൾ, ചിരി ചിരിയല്ലേ .. എന്തുകൊണ്ടാണീ വില വ്യത്യാസം .. ?? അതോ ഞാൻ കുട്ടിയായതിനാൽ  എന്നെ പറ്റിക്കേണോ ?!! "

കച്ചവടക്കാരൻ ചിരിച്ചു കൊണ്ട് :

"വൃദ്ധരുടെ ചിരി വളരെ അപൂർവമാണ് കുഞ്ഞേ .. അതാണ്  വില ഉയർന്നതിന്റെ കാരണം ..."

അയാളെന്താണ് പറയുന്നതെന്ന് എനിക്ക് മനസ്സിലായില്ല .. പക്ഷെ ഞാൻ അദ്ദേഹത്തിന് എന്റെ രണ്ട് ചിരികളും കൊടുത്ത് പകരം  ഒരു പാക്കറ്റ് ബിസ്കറ്റ് വാങ്ങി . ഞാൻ വീട്ടിലെത്തി ഉമ്മാനോട് ചോദിച്ചു: "ഉപ്പാന്റെ  ചിരി വല്ലതും ബാക്കിയുണ്ടോ ?  മുതിർന്നവരുടെ ചിരിക്ക് നല്ല വിലയാണെന്ന് ആ അങ്കിൾ പറഞ്ഞല്ലോ ? "

 പാവം എന്റെ ഉമ്മ വീട് മുഴുവൻ തിരഞ്ഞു , ഉപ്പാന്റെ  ഒരു ചിരിയും കിട്ടിയില്ല. 
പക്ഷെ അവർക്ക് ഉപ്പാന്റെ കണ്ണുനീർ തുള്ളികൾ
ഒരുപാട് കിട്ടി. അതെന്നെ ഏല്പിച്ചു.എന്നിട്ട് പറഞ്ഞു:
 "ഇത് നീ നാളെ അയാൾക്ക് കൊടുത്തു നോക്കൂ .
ബിസ്കറ്റ് വാങ്ങാനുള്ള വല്ലതും കിട്ടും "

അടുത്ത ദിവസം .. ആ അങ്കിളിന്റെ ശബ്ദം വീണ്ടും കേൾക്കുന്നു:

 "സന്തോഷം ...  സൗഭാഗ്യം .. പുഞ്ചിരി ..
 സങ്കടം ...  കണ്ണുനീർ ... വില്ക്കാനുണ്ടോ ?? !! "

ഞാൻ തെല്ലാവേശത്തോടെ അയാളുടെ അടുത്തേക്ക് ഓടിച്ചെന്നു ചോദിച്ചു: "മുതിർന്നവരുടെ കണ്ണീരിന്റെ വിലയെന്താണ് ? "

അയാളുടെ മറുപടി കേട്ടപ്പോൾ ഞാൻ ഞെട്ടി :

"മുതിർന്നവരുടെ കണ്ണുനീർ തീരെ വിലകുറവാണ് മോനേ, ഞാനത് വാങ്ങാറില്ല, 
പഴയ ആളുകൾ എപ്പോഴും കരയും  .അത് കൊണ്ട് ഞാനാ ചൊറക്ക് നിക്കാറില്ല.. !! "

തുടർന്ന് അദ്ദേഹം ശബ്ദം താഴ്ത്തി എന്നോട് പറഞ്ഞു:
"ഇവിടത്തെ പല തെരുവുകളിലും കണ്ണുനീർ നദികളുണ്ട് ..കൂടാതെ ഖബറിസ്ഥാനുകളും
കണ്ണീർ കുണ്ടുകളാണ്.
ശഹീദ് മുഹമ്മദിന്റെ ഉമ്മായ്ക്ക് പോലും രണ്ട് ബാരലിലധികം കണ്ണുനീർ ഉണ്ട് തരാൻ, ഞാൻ അവ വാങ്ങിയില്ല ..
മോനേ, ഞാൻ മുതിർന്നവരുടെ ചിരി വാങ്ങുന്നു, പക്ഷേ അവരുടെ കണ്ണുനീർ അങ്ങനെയല്ല .... ഞാൻ അവ വാങ്ങാറില്ല!…
അപൂർവ ഇടപാടുകാരനാണ് കുട്ടീ ഈ അങ്കിൾ...
ഞാൻ വേശ്യകളിൽ നിന്ന് അഭിമാനം വാങ്ങുന്നു ...
അമ്മമാരിൽ നിന്നുള്ള നുണ ...
ഭ്രാന്തന്മാരുടെ തത്വങ്ങൾ ...
രാഷ്ട്രീയക്കാരന്റെ കൂറ്, നേതാക്കന്മാരുടെ സത്യസന്ധത ഇതൊക്കെയാണ് ഞാൻ തെരയുന്നത്. അവക്ക് അനുയോജ്യമായ വില തരാം. ലോകത്തുള്ള 
പ്രായമായവരൊക്കെ പൊതുവെ കരയുന്നു ... !!
അപ്പോ പിന്നെ എന്ത് ചെയ്യാനാ?

അയാൾ പോകുന്നതിനുമുമ്പ്  എന്റെ ചെവിയിൽ ഇതു കൂടി പറഞ്ഞു: 
ഇന്ന്… വെള്ളിയാഴ്ച
ഉസ്താദിന്റെ പ്രസംഗത്തിൽ ആത്മാർഥത വല്ലതും കിട്ടിയാൽ നാളെ കൊണ്ടുവരുക , പൊന്നും വില തരാം.
രാഷ്ട്രീയക്കാരന്റെ കൂറ് കിട്ടിയാലും കൊണ്ട് വരീൻ, ഒത്തവില പറയാം."

അന്നുമുതൽ ഞാനും ആ അപൂർവ്വ വസ്തുക്കൾ തെരഞ്ഞു കൊണ്ടേ ഇരിക്കുന്നു....!

20/06/2021, 11:40 am - Devi CEA: Summarizing the *queries* recieved so far on the *flight resumption* from India:

1) Flights from *India resumes on 23rd June*

2) Only those who took *2 vaccines of UAE approved vaccines* and *UAE residents* are allowed to travel to *Dubai*

3) *UAE approved vaccines* are:

*a) Sinopharm*
*b) Oxford-AstraZeneca*
*c) Pfizer-BioNTech*
*d) Sputnik*

4) *Covishield* is almost same as *Oxford-AstraZeneca* and *could be accepted by UAE* (Saudi Arabia had earlier in the month accepted that both are the same vaccine).

5) Presently only vaccined passengers can travel to UAE from India. *Clarity needs to come from authorities on Children.*

6) A total of *3 RT PCR* tests need to be completed by the passengers :
a) 48 hrs before travel *(Only QR coded PCR test result accepted)*
b) *4 hrs before travel* (This is also RT PCR test which yields results within minutes). Presently don't know *which all airports has this facility in India* - so better check with authorities before taking tickets.
c) 3rd PCR test is at Dubai Airport. The passenger need to be in Quarantine until the result of this is out.

7) Those who stayed *outside the country for more than 6 months*, mostly *favorable decision will be taken by the authorities as per Indian Consulate* (No official declaration yet).

20/06/2021, 1:33 pm - Femina: Thanks for sharing devi. The confusion is regarding 2nd pcr test. Is it antigen?. Or antigen is enough?
20/06/2021, 1:33 pm - Umesh CEA: Everything is fine the 3 RT PCR tests is horrible

22/06/2021, 7:23 am - Athira CEA: #ഗ്രൂപ്പ്

രാവിലെ കണ്ണ് തുറന്നു ആദ്യം തന്നെ മൊബൈൽ തപ്പി എടുത്തു ഡാറ്റാ ഓൺ ചെയ്തു...

ചക്കപ്പഴത്തിൽ ഈച്ച പൊതിയുന്ന പോലെ വാട്സാപ്പ് മെസ്സേജുകൾ വരാൻ തുടങ്ങി...!

ഗുഡ് മോർണിംഗ് മെസ്സേജുകൾ ആണ് അധികവും...!

കട്ടിലിൽ നിന്നും എഴുന്നേൽക്കാൻ മടി തോന്നി... കുറച്ചു ദിവസമായി എന്തൊരു മഴ ആണ്... ജോലിക്കു പോകേണ്ടാത്തതിനാൽ വലിയ തിരക്ക് കൂട്ടലൊന്നും വേണ്ട. 

ലോക്ക്ഡൌൺ ആയതിൽ പിന്നെ മിക്കവാറും വാട്സാപ്പ് ഗ്രൂപ്പുകളിലും, ഫേസ് ബുക്കിലും ആണ് സമയം കളയുന്നത്... 

നിലവിൽ ഓഫീസിലെ ഗ്രൂപ്പ്‌, 10 ക്ലാസ് ഗ്രൂപ്പ്‌ , അച്ഛൻ വീട്ടിലെ ഗ്രൂപ്പ്‌, അമ്മ വീട്ടിലെ ഗ്രൂപ്പ്,   കഥ, കവിത, ചിത്രം വര ഇതിനൊക്കെ ഉള്ള ഗ്രൂപ്പുകൾ പോരാഞ്ഞിട്ട് ലോക്ക് ഡൌൺ സ്‌പെഷ്യൽ ആയി  പഴം, പച്ചക്കറി, പാൽ, പലചരക്ക്, ചിക്കൻ കട, മീൻ കാരൻ തുടങ്ങി തെങ്ങ് കേറ്റക്കാരൻ കുമാരൻ ചേട്ടനും, സ്ഥിരം ആക്രി എടുക്കുന്ന വേലുച്ചാമി അണ്ണനും വരെ ഗ്രൂപ്പ്‌ അഡ്മിൻ ആണ്...

പെട്ടന്നാണ് പുതിയൊരു ഗ്രൂപ്പിൽ ആഡ് ചെയ്തത് കണ്ടത്...!

"കെട്ട്യോനും പിള്ളേരും"

ആരിത്...?

ഞാൻ വേഗം ഗ്രൂപ്പ്‌ തുറന്ന് ഗ്രൂപ്പ്‌ ഇൻഫർമേഷൻ നോക്കി...

"അഡ്മിൻ അമ്മ...!"

ഇതിനാണോ ഇന്നലെ ചേട്ടന്റെ പഴയ ഫോൺ വാങ്ങി എന്നെ കൊണ്ട് വാട്സാപ്പ് ഡൌൺലോഡ് ചെയ്യിപ്പിച്ചു ചോദിച്ചു പഠിച്ചത്.

അമ്മേ... അമ്മയും...!'

പെട്ടന്ന് മെസ്സേജ് വന്നു തുടങ്ങി...

"അമ്മ: രാവിലെ പുട്ടും കടലയും ആണ് ഉണ്ടാക്കുന്നത്..." "മുട്ട പുഴുങ്ങിയത് വേണ്ടവർ 👍 ഇടുക." "ബുൾസ് ഐ  വേണ്ടവർ👍👍 ഇടുക..."

മെസ്സേജ് വീണ്ടും...



"ചേട്ടൻ: ഡബിൾ 👍👍"

ഞാൻ വേഗം ചാടി എഴുന്നേറ്റ് അടുക്കളയിലേക്കോടി...
 
അമ്മ പുട്ടിന്റെ പൊടി എടുത്തു വെച്ചിട്ടുണ്ട്...

തേങ്ങ ചിരവണം...
 
"അമ്മേ.. എന്താമ്മേ ഗ്രൂപ്പ് ഒക്കെ..."

"പിന്നല്ലാതെ.. ഓരോരുത്തരുടെയും പുറകെ ഒരു കാര്യം പറഞ്ഞു ഞാൻ മടുത്തു."
ഉണ്ടാക്കിയിട്ട് കഴിക്കാൻ വിളിക്കുമ്പോ അതുപോര... ഇതുപോര..."
ഇതാകുമ്പോൾ ഒരു ബുദ്ധിമുട്ടും ഇല്ല. ഒറ്റത്തവണ കാര്യം പറഞ്ഞാൽ മതി. എല്ലാരും അറിഞ്ഞോളും... എന്റെ എനർജിയും കളയണ്ട. പിന്നെ മൊനേ സകലർക്കും ഉണ്ട്‌ ഗ്രൂപ്പ്‌.. അമ്മയും ആകട്ടെന്നേ ഒരു അഡ്മിൻ...

ഞാൻ പിന്നെ ഒന്നും മിണ്ടിയില്ല. വേഗം തേങ്ങ ചിരകി തുടങ്ങി... കൂടുതൽ പറഞ്ഞാൽ ചിലപ്പോ റിമൂവ് ചെയ്താലോ... 
പട്ടിണി ആയിപ്പോകും... 
എന്ത് പറയാനാ ... 
എല്ലാം കൈവിട്ട് പൊയി
🥴🥴🥴😃😃😃

23/06/2021, 11:27 am - Deepu CEA: Really I don't know. Everyone is acting like , this is the very first case of this type.Vismaya is just one of the victims.. All the media, politicians, even our cultural heroes are mourning.. and they will do this un till there is another scandal or something comes out.. 
To be frank,there is no one or no law to protect our girls. Every parent is forced to keep their daughters under their wings in defense and pray for their safety.
And Marriage.. it has become some kind of gambling these days.
We ask money even for useless scraps, and we give money (so called dowry) to someone to marry our girls !!!!!!!!
Parents should start thinking on how to prepare their daughters, to become independent. And not to save money for the dowry..

02/07/2021, 8:06 am - Athira CEA: Athe....Nayattu was(is) an excellent movie...sambhavam! It was a gritty revelation into the life of an average Kerala policeman. The climax is subtle but hard hitting . We are left hanging to complete the rest , according to how each one of us views life and its unfairness....I love Joju 🥰.... and Dinesh( the new comer) is ingenious..alle?Nimisha ... of course is a natural... Kunchacko has done a very neat acting in this,compared to his performance in ‘Nizhal’
02/07/2021, 8:24 am - Umesh CEA: Joju yes..he has transformed..has been a good actor always..Dinesh you mean the kalippan?
02/07/2021, 8:35 am - Athira CEA: Athe... he portrayed the character ‘Biju’ ... the troublemaker in the police station

03/07/2021, 8:32 am - Athira CEA: Ah!!! Ath... yes... but useless aayitalla....

I have always been an admirer of ur cool but very disciplined and time managed lifestyle... even in studies matter, I tell them how u used to come to hostel after college and take a good bath and sleep off comfortably under the blankets , with ur long black tresses still dripping water,while the whole hostel would be buzzing with life , chaos, shrieks, giggles .. and little forms of mayhem..😂.... and when all the energy is drained out from each of us and we sleep off in whatever posture we were in( sitting, standing....dreaming).... u would ‘rise’ full charged😅 and have ur dinner. Pinne irunnu oru padithama... raavile hostel ezhunelkkunna vare❤️❤️👏👏👏👏👏I make my kids do that here.... and it works!!!🤩🤩so thank you for that and the warm wishes!! Hugs 🤗

Very low margin, low ARPU, and everything available for a business loss. Still trying hard to provide service to such areas on the commitment to the society 🇮🇳

Aptly said da”bygone era”....
This melodious song( its lyrics specially) takes us through the overgrown shrubs,the rain-kissed idavazhikal, the nostalgic accompanying groves,oonjaal , thodukal etc around Janakikutty’s home. She  walks round so carefree....  munching guavas, looking for squirrels ....😍❤️...I feel a connection with this song as it takes me back to my first five years of my life which I spent with my grandmother in Kollam.My parents and Unniannan were in Trivandrum and I was in the care of my grandmother . We were in a big joint family....almost 10 members... I grew up amongst them all , each with different temperaments and characters. Though I was brought up pampered, at times , I felt very lonely ( missing amma and Pappa), and most of my time was spent alone in the backyards of the home which almost resembles the scenery in the movie.This movie is one which every child brought up in rural Kerala pre-2000s would relate to. 
It rained the past two days here and I found myself feeling happy and nostalgic to the sound of the rain( maybe because I was born in the month when the monsoon is at its best). The sound of the rain , the petrichor and the splashing of water in the puddles gave colour to the memories i had left behind as a child.I felt the urge to share this song as it makes me yearn for Kerala and specially my grandmother’s place in Thevalli,... the Kadavoor Mahadeva Kshetram where I spent my whole childhood watching the utsavams and Shivaraatris.
Ha! Oru nalla feel..... 😇
and I am sure u all feel like “ ente eeshwaraaa.... ithinoru avasaanam ille?....enthoru vadham!”😂

04/10/2021, 10:11 am - Athira CEA: Now for the review:
Njaan generally  horror movies or movies with torture or anything like that avoid cheyyara pathivu.
I was actually looking for ghosts in this movie 😅 I won’t call this movie as “horror-as-in-ghost-horror”...but it is definitely a psychological thriller...the movie left me with a strange feeling .It is creepy..but not creepy enough that i have to lock my door, put a chair on it and sleep with one eye open.
The character Esther’s performance is amazing ... to think that she is actually only 11 years old!!! But I felt that the husband character was too oblivious to want to know the truth( it was sort of frustrating 🙄)when all the dots are clearly connected.
The twist in the movie ending certainly came as a surprise.
I got goosebumps when her real self got revealed....
Whew! A good watch da Devi.... thanks a lot for persuading me to watch it....though I had mentally prepared myself to expect the worst.... it was a decent psychological thriller movie....👍❤️

12/10/2021, 7:58 am - Devi CEA: Good morning allll.....Yesterday afternoon we have lost a great artist ...nedumudi venu...grihaathurathwam unarthunna presence ennallathe onnu visheshippikaan illa,...I remember this song Chandanam manakkunna poonthottam ..the movie I think is called Achuvettante veedu...His presence in the movie was for very short span yet looming so large that the movie revolves around both his absence and presence....lovely movie ...but recently I saw him do a rather unconventional role in the movie Aanum Pennum....pls watch it if you haven't guys ..it's an anthology and the last film in it has him .....the movie canvas moves to him and Kaviyoor ponnamma as the cheeky naughty older couple, you are in awe of talent and the familiarity these fine actors bring home.....pls do watch if you havent.... 👍
Tribute to a true artist who lived the Art and gave us such memories....RIP Nedumudi 🌼🙏

12/10/2021, 8:00 am - Femina: 👍👍 pranamam
12/10/2021, 8:41 am - Athira CEA: Rightly said da....I always got the feel of him as the avuncular type ... like the uncle from either side of the family.Every role he got into, he would try and get under the skin of the character. As u said Devi, he could leave a mark regardless of the length of his part. I loved him in ‘Oru Minnaminunginte Nurunguvettam’,where he is paired with actress Sarada( one of my ever time favourite), ‘Santhwanam’... and to show his versatility on handling and essaying any character.... even the comedy character in ‘Odaruthammaavaa aalariyaam’😂
Pettannu oru list parayaan paranjaal adehathinte actor enna nilayil, some of the most poignant moments are those born out of his onscreen interactions with Mohanlal.. alle?... like  in Chithram, Thalavattam,Akkare Akkare Akkare, and His Highness Abdullah, Bharatham and even the villain role in Chambakulam Thachan and of course aarrkka marakkaan kazhiyuka his role in Panchavadi Paalam..... ippol aa film-le 4 great actors ippol illa.... Nedumudi Venu, Bharat Gopi, Sreevidya, Sukumaari.😔
12/10/2021, 8:44 am - Athira CEA: And yes... ‘Aanum Pennum’ kandu..... I did notice the unconventional role( esp Kaviyoor Ponnamma’s) he had essayed... aa character maatramee avide muzhach ninnullu... Nedumudi Venu Enna vaikthi avide illeeilla.... great actor... great loss

18/10/2021, 6:48 am - Umesh CEA: ഓർമ്മ മഴ
------------------

ഓർമ്മകൾ തൂമഴപോൽ പെയ്തിറങ്ങവേ
ആ മഴച്ചാർത്തു കുഞ്ഞോളങ്ങൾ നെയ്കയായ്...
ഓർമ്മ തന്നോളപ്പരപ്പിലൂടങ്ങിങ്ങെൻ
ഓമനപ്പൊൻതോണി ഓടിക്കളിക്കയായ് ...

ഓർമ്മയാം ധാരയെൻ മെയ്യെത്തലോടി , ആ
നീർതുള്ളി എൻകാതിൽ കിന്നാരം ചൊല്ലവേ..
ഇന്നെന്റെ മാനസത്തോണിയിലേറി ഞാൻ
ചെന്നെൻ മനോഹര ജീവതീരങ്ങളിൽ!!

ചക്കര മാമ്പഴമൊന്നു രുചിക്കുവാൻ
ദിക്കുകൾ താണ്ടി വരുന്ന കാറ്റിൻ കയ്യെ-
വിട്ടു താഴേക്കു പതിച്ചൊരാ മാമ്പഴം 
തട്ടിയെടുത്തോടിമായുമെൻ ബാല്യവും ...

അമ്പല മുറ്റത്താ സന്ധ്യയിൽ തന്മിഴി-
യമ്പുകൊണ്ടെൻ ഹൃത്തിൽ ചിത്രം രചിച്ചൊരാ
സുന്ദരീ, നിന്നോർമ ഉന്മാദമായൊരെൻ
സുന്ദര യൗവന കാലവും കണ്ടൂ ഞാൻ ...

ഒടുവിലാത്തോണി കരയ്ക്കടുക്കുമ്പോ-
ളൊരു നേർത്ത വിങ്ങലെൻ കരളെ മൂടി..
പടവേറി തെല്ലിട നിന്നു ഞാൻ പിന്നെ 
വെറുതെയായ് പിന്തിരിഞ്ഞൊന്നു നോക്കി...
ഇട മുറിഞ്ഞീടാതെ പെയ്യുകയായിരു-
ന്നിട നെഞ്ചിലപ്പോഴുമോർമപ്പെരുമഴ!!

Aashish Nambudiri, Annie, few seniors are here in Sydney as well. Soumya, and few others in other states.
We'll meet and add some selfie contributing to missing pieces of that collage. Your ideas well taken Devi, Ansha.

However,  we guys used to meet till few years ago, when world was normal...and did share lot of selfie and mixies🤩
30/10/2021, 5:21 pm - Devi CEA: Well let's not mention the selfie part to Annan then....you might never meet.. ☺️
Yes let's collect as far as possible the current pics  and then perhaps include older selfies shared here....good idea..

25/11/2021, 8:30 am - Mangal: കഞ്ചാവ് അടിച്ചിട്ട് എന്ത് എങ്കിലും ഉണ്ടാക്കി വെക്കും.
അത് promote ചെയ്യാൻ കുറെ കപട ബുദ്ധി ജീവികളും.
ഇത് ഒരു കോപ്പ് classic/cult ഒന്നും അല്ല. വെറും കഞ്ചാവ് പടം. പച്ച ആയ ജീവിതം ഇങ്ങനെ ചീത്ത വിളി ആണോ?

Climax ആദ്യം പറഞ്ഞു വെക്കുന്നുണ്ടല്ലോ. മാടൻ തിരുമേനിയെ മാടൻ കറക്കി കൊണ്ടിരിക്കുന്നത്. അത്പോലെ സൗബിൻ ഈ പൊട്ടൻമാരെ കറക്കി കൊണ്ടിരിക്കുന്നു. അത്ര മാത്രം. അതിനാണ് ഇവന്മാർ "mysterious puzzle"എന്നൊക്കെ പറയുന്നത്. കോപ്പ്..
ഇവൻ്റെ ഭാഷയിൽ പറഞാൽ #@&**£@#
25/11/2021, 8:31 am - Mangal: 👍
25/11/2021, 8:31 am - Mangal: 😂😂😂
25/11/2021, 8:42 am - +971 50 920 3301: It is definitely not a classic by light years, but it will be cult for sure, why?.. watch what happens from hence forth, barriers of decency in terms language used will be a thing of the past, amateurs will use this as a benchmark to create their mark.." a milestone in malayalam cinema" for wrong reasons...Now even Santhosh Pandit can logically argue his movies are better😂...times are changing too fast now, and any change is becoming a norm without much resistance...there was a time when initmate scenes where depicted using waves crashing on rocks, lighting etc😂.. now that will change too..the line between pornography and art will be blurred soon and will become the norm. Thats where classics of the 80s remain the gold standard, still cherished and watched atleast by our generation.

30/11/2021, 7:59 am - Athira CEA: Turning on the  camera will not transform me into an effective virtual communicator.
Frankly , my problem is social anxiety....and it usually centers on being afraid that others will judge me negatively. I tend to focus on physiological signs of anxiety such as a racing heart, sweaty palms, flushed face.....which are embarrassing ,because I think others will notice it and think poorly of me. Manassilaayaacha?

Truly da... there are two things I do with ease and passion.... teaching and dancing on stage... ee randu kaaryangal ( touchwood) I don’t have any racing heart or even butterflies in my stomach.... I love being around in class with my students( kurachu ahangaarathode parayukaya... they love me and look forward to my classes....

I was asked to emulate a teacher.... I loved it ... and I wanted to be one since then. 
Athupole dance.... stage-il with all the attire and ornaments ... I feel liberated... at the same time when I am asked to dance in front of a small group or gathering in my normal everyday attire, I feel conscious... I still remember the day I danced in front of ettan’s friends and their families.. a small gathering of 15.... enne avide munnil onnu ethikkaan Ettan Petta Paadu...he was very patient and very supportive... athu kondu njaan annu kuzhappam illathe cheythu.... what I meant to say is how social anxiety is weighing me down...

30/11/2021, 9:52 am - Ratheesh Kamu: Athira.. Good to see you open up and talk about this. Dont worry da. U r an awsome person..
I completely agree with what Ansha nd Devi told you about this.
Everybody has this feeling of being conscious infront of others and feeling of discomfort in a group of strangers. Just that the degree of feeling varies from human to human.
But we are not strangers anymore😜😜. Though we dont talk each other every other day, we all know each other for almost half a century!! So no need of any inhibitions in expressing urself.ok? 
I was kind of surprised to read abt it just now. The Athira we all know is too 
Jovial, confident, fun loving nd outgoing. And am pretty sure thats the image most of us will have here in this group.. Thats the statement u gave urself out all the 4 years in college and after that whenever we interacted with u too. We all know u like that. So never be afraid that people will judge u wrongly. Not at all..
So Dhairyamayi join cheyyanam next time ktto? Infact, we all would wanna see u again soon !!😊
30/11/2021, 9:55 am - Ratheesh Kamu: Sorry Athira.. Half a century ennulkathu ithiri kaduthu poyi. I meant quarter of a century.😂😂 Dayavu cheythu angane thiruthi vayikkan apeksha 😃😃

30/11/2021, 10:05 am - Athira CEA: Ratheesheee.... thanks a lot for taking out time to write out those words for me.....yes ... the Athira you know is certainly jovial, most certainly fun loving, to a good extent confident and maybe a medium level outgoing..... but I am all these in its peak when I am with a certain handful of people alone...☺️they know me as this and more ... and I certainly live up to all those ‘parameters’ ..... otherwise .... I become conscious with hi-bye relations 😅...... but feeling so so so good ‘hearing’ the warmth from your words.... I still feel the same with u ... very very pleasant and open warm closeness.....thank you 🤝👍👍
30/11/2021, 10:07 am - Athira CEA: Thiruthunnilla 😎..... don’t u know that friends and relations are nothing but repetitions of janmas.... same souls in different bodies keep on interacting janma over janma...☺️

30/11/2021, 10:08 am - Ratheesh Kamu: Thibk about this.. How many people you met this week, their mannerisms u remember now?
Everyone is like that. They wont remember all these things.All are be busy with their lives. So dont think too much about it and be concious abt urself.. Just live the way you are.. Trust me, u r a super nice person!!😊😊
30/11/2021, 10:16 am - Athira CEA: Njaan innu aareyaano Kani Kandathu!🥰🥰enne kurichu ingane vaa thoraathe nallathu paranju kelkkumbol maaraka samthripthi ...😃

Actually, I take time and notice most things about people I come across..... that may be why I still have memories fresh and etched in me about all of u.... the encounters... the talks... the expressions.... the silent looks... meaningful looks 😉.... the unsaid words of criticism, like, hate ... etc.... so when there is even a bit difference in what I have learnt and understood about each one of u from my 4 years and a bit more years (which is not a small span)I immediately tend to think that it has got something to do with me ... though it may be not... so when u ask how many will remember what we said or did, I do 😖.... which I start expecting others might also do...
But hearing that most are not abnormal like me 🤪is a calming thought.... yes... all are busy with their lives and problems..... so live the way we are 👌👌loved that...
30/11/2021, 10:17 am - Athira CEA: Entammmeeee.... GT stillllllll typing...... kaaryamaayi enikkittenthoo varunnundu( see ! See ! See! This is exactly my problem.... he may be typing about the game he watched ... but I think it will be about me 😂)
30/11/2021, 10:17 am - GT Australia: Good one Devi..!!👌🏻
Brave Athira..! Everyone has this issue..only differs in how they deal with it. Some know how to manage it. That's it.

While trying to address a gathering of 100 people, you see all those in front of you and feel sweaty already ..

But in reality,  from audience end do we damn care about a speaker delivering regular sppech..we don't go in detail  about what he does.. Such thought process helps when I had to face audience.

So it's in everyone's life..we live with it..( Just Corona does :) )

 ...and this forward is I felt so timely today in the midst of our discussion

Freedom!! .....that our minds have a free will from any layers of inhibition and sense of shame....that we can display our enjoyment according to our own rulebook, having an attitude as "I Love it and so should you"....This will help all entertainers...Athi you dance and write well...just follow your heart and you only need to *Allow* it to express without any boundaries...you will see the difference ... ❤️#Love you any way ...

03/12/2021, 7:02 pm - Devi CEA: Dupatta....the dangling cloth on which rested the confidence and dignity and etc etc ... of crores of women  ...it's a bygone era..... the sheer amount of time we have spent to match colours ..and fabric and texture in textile shops...seems like stone age now .....what we're our priorities alle.....😳😳🤣😂

03/12/2021, 7:41 pm - Femina: VSSC
04/12/2021, 12:10 am - +91 94006 41248: Yes its Urmila and Reena... they were super juniors..
04/12/2021, 7:20 am - Devi CEA: To be honest, I felt like  a loner liking the movie and giving it merit for it's visual brilliance and technical work..there seems to rampant negativity in all reviews so i refrained from giving you guys my feedback....although I really did want to type in....chodicha stithikku parayaaam....i liked what I got for 150rs... 😀
04/12/2021, 7:23 am - Devi CEA: Somehow I feel there is a well planned negative propaganda......I gave 150 rs and saw a movie that spend 400 crores.....how many times can I see a mallu movie like that I don't know .....and I'm satisfied... 

The Andhra guys made Bahubali big....and magnificent with their support and banter globally ...for the franchise.....it's stupid fantastical if you really critique it...the negative propaganda against marakkar is disappointing.. the movie then is as bad as urumi and pazhassiraja.....i would say.
04/12/2021, 7:30 am - Devi CEA: Now about the movie I would say seasoned actors , well balanced acting, promising next gen talent, big picture effects, samayam eduthu cinema undakkiyathu kaanan undu...many sequences were shot well but many looked fake too( understandably because of the scale)..
Overall the larger message of compassion and righteousness held its grip in the story..
Some loose ends in the scripts, and song sequence -priyadarshan style gave me nostalgia but was not palatable for many
My take is you would either like it or hate it...but it's worth finding out on a large screen with popcorn.....Anyday better than a Churuli or other crass that releases these days .....
04/12/2021, 7:34 am - Devi CEA: <Media omitted>
04/12/2021, 7:36 am - Devi CEA: For the gals, 😂 I would watch the movie once more for Arjun and Sunil Shetty....😍...
04/12/2021, 8:32 am - Mangal: Had Bahubali been made in Malayalam, our intelligent critics would have degraded and killed it. 
We like only class movies like jellikkettu and churuli.

Devi, I share your view. There's is negative propaganda against it. 

I believe it's planned
04/12/2021, 8:48 am - Femina: Well conveyed Devi. Thanks.
04/12/2021, 9:02 am - Ratheesh Kamu: Agree with you in full, Devi... I haven't watched the movie yet..whether it is good or bad, whats the need to degrade in such a  level.. if u don't like it, let it be.. there could be other people who like it r even hate it more than u do.  By doing such level of degrading these people don't understand that they are spoiling the possibility of Malayalam movies going big ..Eventually our language is also at losing end..
04/12/2021, 9:04 am - Ratheesh Kamu: Haha..that's true 😃 Bahubalikku vavu bali ittene nammal ellarum koodi
04/12/2021, 9:07 am - Ratheesh Kamu: Welcome, Jincy..  Nice to see u after so long.

23/12/2021, 7:13 pm - Devi CEA: Guys listen to this lovely song as you wind down for Christmas.... 

It's such a soulful rendering... I by chance saw this movie Bhoomiyile manohara swakaaryam... Released somewhere in 2019.....I am amused that there are no reviews abt this story despite  it being such a reality in our society even today... The message at the end is commendable of every living and moving form ( that are not us humans) having no barrier of Name , caste or religion, thus explaining all the rigid equations we made for ourselves, and celebrate as humans... Certainly one time watch.... Excusing many things that could have been done better... Camera and acting, 👍👍

28/12/2021, 2:20 pm - SijeshP: I don't vote for creating another group within a group. We are repeating the same mistake. Lets have frequent calls atleast once in a quarter. Don't wait for everyone's time or convenience. Whoever attends, we can spend fruitful time and next time others can attend. This might help in  reducing the gap between us and also help us to be more open.

In a way if we stick to important dates, and info in this group, then people also don't miss out on messages while scrolling that are relevant enough among many random stuff we send each other...... Is that what you had in mind.

Regarding participation on a regular basis,we can't expect everyone to contribute with the same intensity at all times. Kudos to those who make it a priority to do it.
But for others , may be we should give it some more time.. I too agree with the suggestion of quarterly zoom calls..so that we are better connected😃.

 നിൻറെ ബുദ്ധി എനിക്ക് ഇഷ്ടപ്പെട്ടു.. ഇത് കൊണ്ടായിരിക്കും അമേരിക്കക്കാർ ഇവളെ വിടാത്തത്.

പിന്നെ എല്ലാവരും എല്ലാത്തിനും comment ചെയ്യണം എന്നൊക്കെ പറയുന്നത് കുറച്ച് കടന്ന കൈ അല്ലേ?

I do agree many a times ..it is quite difficult to comment ...us being in different time zones ...phone edukumbol sometimes it shows 100+ messages...ellam vayichu comment cheyan late aakum...pinne yes i do watch noops videos and comment at times ...put forth bday messages..all this because i want to keep the bond intact..

I would ask you to keep this group going..and allow everyone to comment at their space and time as I believe we all have our many responsibilities we can't neglect... afterall we are friends ..accept everyone the way they are..

29/12/2021, 7:19 am - +91 99645 83155: To read the 11 minute message I had to find time😊. Ok I don't have any problem  if some of you want another  group. Since we are in many groups we face the same situation everywhere. Some might have already found the support you told about from some other places  . But they still want to continue  our friendship. For me personally  friendship  is not just for jokes but  practical. That happens mostly personally. I really support those who want to have active group, if they want to get that support.  But don't ignore people who want to sit silent and read and respond  once in a while. As Ragi said it is not easy to read 100 messages  together but surely I will support  any one in need for whatever in my limited circumstances.

അന്നു വേറെ റേഞ്ചിലാക്കിയിരുന്ന, ഇന്ദുവിനപ്പുറം നമ്മുടെ മലയാളം പോകുമോ എന്നു കരുതി നടന്ന കാലത്തിൽ നിന്നു ഇന്നിവർക്കിടയിലേക്കിടിച്ചു കയറുകയായിരുന്നു.😊
ടീനയെ കണ്ടു ഞാൻ ഞെട്ടി, 😳 കാരണം ഒരിക്കലും പ്രതീക്ഷിച്ചിരുന്നില്ല. അന്നും ഇന്നും നന്മയുടെ നിറകുടം + ഇന്റർനാഷണൽ വ്യക്തിത്വം🙏👍
ദേവിക്ക് പരിഭവങ്ങളൊരു പാടുണ്ട്. ബന്ധങ്ങൾക്ക് പുള്ളിക്കാരി വലിയ വിലമതിക്കുന്നു.🙏

08/01/2022, 10:59 pm - Athira CEA: Sharing one of his most favourite song( though the song is a sad one ,not suitable for the occasion, sharing it ,as it is , I believe , is one of Umesh’s favourite song)👇

10/01/2022, 9:16 pm - Anisha ranjith: Someone who is a true friend stands up for you. When others try to hurt you emotionally or physically, they do everything they can to make sure you stay safe. They don’t care who is trying to harm you; they will defend you anytime, anywhere. If they can help you, they’ll do it without reservation or reward. A true friend is not one who repeatedly is telling you negative things other people say about you. First, they make it clear by their words and by their actions where they stand when it comes to you. Secondly, they don’t just merely standby silently when others are tearing you down no matter what consequences they may face socially. A true friend is a friend when is convenient and when it is not. They standby you consistently both when you are present and when you are not..

16/01/2022, 9:49 am - Umesh CEA: once again proves that justice and judiciary are not always the same...and no RCA demanded from any countries even after 2 years.. they cant fight against the most powerful country
16/01/2022, 10:37 am - Devi CEA: The difference between mortals and mere - mortals,  for the ordinary it's either justice denied or justice delayed.. Abhaya stood the test of time... And won..... But do we, in this era need to wait  for so long.. Or even give the bishop whatever remains of his youth( time) and have him pay at the age of 80+....you just lose hope... Dileeps fate is already sealed, perhaps.. We like fools will have to wait for final verdict. I hope that's not the case..
16/01/2022, 10:43 am - Devi CEA: Hemalata report on the wcc is another case where we hopelessly wait for justice, based on the idealistic hope that sense will prevail eventually... But really in this day and age the time Spent in resolutions on topics of basic human rights mixing no gender or class.... Is absolutely not upto the times we are in...
16/01/2022, 10:46 am - Devi CEA: Parathiyum, paribhavam onnum alla... ☺️.... Just voicing what many feel after the verdict yesterday....

16/01/2022, 7:41 pm - Umesh CEA: especially in such cases the prosecution should come up with solid proofs ..this is not the first time such things happened..really sorry state..a small good thing is it will be fought in high court is what I heard..but giving him time to enjoy all his life and then closing is a waste..
16/01/2022, 7:41 pm - Umesh CEA: Money is big power every where.
16/01/2022, 7:43 pm - Umesh CEA: true..we will do that but my small view is there will be such people always in society to do the wrong things..we need stricter punishments and faster justice with good people fighting cases
16/01/2022, 7:45 pm - Umesh CEA: 😁😁 do you believe all this whitewashing..till date they have not accepted the truth..this started early december and people died there but it took them one month to tell the world..whole world suffering even after 2 years
16/01/2022, 7:57 pm - SijeshP: World is not a fair place !! We have to live with it. It's all about changing the definition of fairness.
16/01/2022, 8:11 pm - +91 99645 83155: True
16/01/2022, 8:21 pm - +41 76 439 60 96: Ayoo... let's not think like that..." we have to live with it"... let's not say its we'll  manage... the more the common people  remain silent, the more this (injustuce will  be tolerated) and incidents like this will continue ...
Let us not change  the definition of fairness... what is right is right and wrong is wrong ... 
Of course we can argue that right and wrong are matter of perspectives
16/01/2022, 8:30 pm - Deepu CEA: I don't think the judiciary is influenced here. That judge has a good career record. But it's a complete disappointing judgement. Not sure what message it gives to the society.
16/01/2022, 10:48 pm - Umesh CEA: 👍
16/01/2022, 10:49 pm - Umesh CEA: I meant the people around and not the judge..he will only look at the artefacts presented..so its upto the people who provide them

23/01/2022, 2:07 pm - Athira CEA: This happiness was unexpected .... and is truly a blessing ... as I was not able to submit my paper for peer review on Dec8 th as I was in Kerala( my mother in law had passed away).... but luckily the date got extended to 14 th Dec .I completed my paper     during the late night hours with poor network connectivity issues and time constraints.... and submitted it couple of minutes before the ‘window of submission’ closed. 
The paper presentation was scheduled on 27 th and 28th Dec... but we returned back from Kerala on 26 th night.... athum tension aayi... as I had not prepared the ppt for the presentation... but made it ! As I was not expecting anything out of it , rather only to present it... I was not tensed .. so I presented my paper before the iit +nit professors without any anxiety...
Maybe what I am trying to project is that we all perform best under adverse situations .... 
so next time you feel dejected over anything or feel that u might not make it... don’t lose hope .... keep going and perform your best !
23/01/2022, 2:08 pm - Athira CEA: Good to know that GT ! Please do pursue it so that I can discuss my doubts with u too ☺️

29/01/2022, 9:59 am - Athira CEA: Goodmorning....came across this song in the movie “Shyam Singha Roy”( Telugu)
Loved this song praising Goddess Durga.... it is a classical feast... with the classical essence of the song, the classical dance, and the setting of the temple. I personally loved the Tamil version of the song. Sharing all three languages the song has been sung in. 
Was also daydreaming about how exciting it would be , had it been performed on stage ( group dance) in our college days😅🥰🥰🥰

“Rahe na rahe hum mahakaa karenge...”
Whether or not I am here, this fragrance will remain.....

10/02/2022, 6:52 pm - Athira CEA: മലയാളികളുടെ സ്ഥായിയായ ഭാവം വിഷാദത്തിന്റെതാണ് എന്ന് തോന്നാറുണ്ട്..!!

ഏതെങ്കിലും മലയാളിയോട് എന്തൊക്കെയാണ് വിശേഷങ്ങൾ എന്ന് ചോദിച്ചാൽ
"കുഴപ്പമില്ല"
അല്ലെങ്കിൽ
"അങ്ങനെയൊക്കെ പോകുന്നു"
എന്ന മറുപടിയാണ് കിട്ടുക...!!

ഇവിടെ രസകരമായ ചില കാര്യങ്ങൾ പരീക്ഷിച്ചു നോക്കാൻ നമുക്ക് കഴിയും..
ആരെങ്കിലും എന്താണ് വിശേഷം എന്ന് ചോദിച്ചാൽ വെറുതെ "അടിപൊളി" എന്നൊന്ന് പറഞ്ഞു നോക്കൂ....!!!!

മറ്റെയാൾ ആകെ ചമ്മി വിളറി വെളുത്തിട്ടുണ്ടാകും..
കാരണം അയാൾ ആഗ്രഹിക്കുന്നത് 
 ""കുഴപ്പമില്ല"" എന്ന മറുപടി കേൾക്കാനാണ്....

വേറൊരാൾ നന്നായിരുന്നാൽ കുഴപ്പം തോന്നുന്ന ഏക വർഗ്ഗം മലയാളിയാണ്...!!!

ഒരു തമിഴനോട് ചോദിച്ചു നോക്കൂ...
"എപ്പടി ഇരുക്ക്"
മറുപടി 
"റൊമ്പ പ്രമാദം സാർ"" എന്നായിരിക്കും.

ഒരു ഹിന്ദിക്കാരനോട് ചോദിക്ക്, അവൻ പറയുക "ബഹുത് അച്ഛാ" അല്ലെങ്കിൽ "ബഹുത് ബടിയാ "
എന്നായിരിക്കും..

ഒരു ഇംഗ്ലീഷുകാരനോട്  ചോദിക്കുക, അവൻ പറയുക "ഫൈൻ" അല്ലെങ്കിൽ "ഗ്രേറ്റ്" എന്ന്......

ഒരു അറബിയോട്
ചോദിച്ചാൽ
"അൽഹംദുലില്ലാ " അല്ലെങ്കിൽ 
"അൽക്വൈസ്" എന്നു പറയും.. എല്ലാം പോസിറ്റീവ് ആയ പദങ്ങൾ..

ആരെങ്കിലും ചിരിക്കുന്നത് കണ്ടാൽ ഏറ്റവുമധികം അസ്വസ്ഥരാകുന്നത് മലയാളികളാണ്.....!!!!

കാരണം വളരെ ലളിതമാണ്.... അവനു ചിരിക്കാൻ കഴിയില്ല..
ഇനി ചിരി വന്നാലോ അതടിച്ചമർത്തി ഒരു ഭാഗത്ത് നീങ്ങിയിരിക്കും അത്ര തന്നെ...!!

കാരണം മലയാളി ജീവിക്കുന്നത് അവന്റെ ഭൂതകാലങ്ങളിലും  ഭാവി കാലങ്ങളിലും മാത്രമാണ്....!!!

അവന് ചുറ്റുപാടുകളെ, പ്രകൃതിയെ,പൂക്കളെ, നക്ഷത്രങ്ങളെ, കാൽ ചവുട്ടുന്ന മണ്ണിനെ,ചുറ്റുമുള്ള മനുഷ്യരെ ഒന്നും ശ്രദ്ധിക്കാൻ സമയമില്ല...!!!
അവൻ എപ്പോഴും ബിസിയാണ്...

എന്തിനോ ഒക്കെ വേണ്ടിയുള്ള ഓട്ടത്തിലാണവൻ ....
മക്കൾക്കു വേണ്ടി, അച്ഛനമ്മമാർക്ക് വേണ്ടി,
ഭാര്യക്കും ഭർത്താവിനും വേണ്ടി ജീവിതം ഹോമിച്ചു കൊണ്ടിരിക്കുകയാണ്.....!!!

തനിക്ക് വേണ്ടി ജീവിക്കുകയോ?
ആ ചോദ്യം തന്നെ അവന് താങ്ങാൻ കഴിയുന്ന ഒന്നല്ല...!!!

അവന് ഒന്നിനും സമയമില്ല.. ജീവിക്കാൻ മറന്നവന്ന് എവിടെയാണ് ആഹ്ലാദം?

ജീവിതം കൈവിട്ടു പോയവൻ എങ്ങനെ ചിരിക്കാനാണ്...
അവനെ സംബന്ധിച്ച് ഫലിതം വെറും "വളിപ്പാ"കുന്നു.അല്ലെങ്കിൽ "ചെളി"യെന്ന ന്യു ജൻ ഭാഷയിൽ കൊഞ്ഞനം കുത്തൽ..

മലയാളിയുടെ വീട്ടിൽ കറണ്ട് പോയാൽ അവൻ ചെയ്യുന്ന ഒരു പണിയുണ്ട്....
 ""കറൻറ് പോയല്ലോ ""
എന്നു പറയുകയും ഉടനെ തന്നെ വാതിൽ തുറന്നു പുറത്തിറങ്ങി അപ്പുറത്തെ വീട്ടിൽ കറണ്ട് ഉണ്ടോ എന്ന് ഉറപ്പാക്കുകയും ചെയ്യും ....!!!

അവിടെയും കറണ്ടില്ലെങ്കിൽ അവന് ആശ്വാസമായി .... അതായത് എനിക്കോ കറണ്ടില്ല, അവനും കറണ്ടില്ലല്ലോ....!!!

ഇതുതന്നെയാണ് മലയാളിയുടെ മനോഭാവം....
മറ്റുള്ളവരുടെ സങ്കടം കാണുമ്പോൾ സന്തോഷിക്കുന്ന അസൂയ നിറഞ്ഞ മനസ്സാണ് മലയാളിയുടെത്..

ആരെങ്കിലും ചിരിച്ചാൽ, സന്തോഷിച്ചാൽ, ആഘോഷിച്ചാൽ, അവർക്കെല്ലാം എന്തോ കുഴപ്പമുണ്ട് എന്നതാണ് അവന്റെ നിലപാട്...!!!

കുഴപ്പം ന്ന് വെച്ചാല് വട്ട്, അത് തന്നെ...!!!

പ്രണയത്തിന്റെ ലഹരി (ഇതൊരു അശ്ലീലമാണ് പലർക്കും ),
അതു പോലെ ആഹ്ലാദം, ഉന്മാദം, ശാന്തത, എന്തിന് സന്തോഷം പോലും അവന് അന്യമാണ്...!!!!

ആഹ്ലാദത്തിന്റെ പല അവസ്ഥകളെ അവൻ അവന്റെ നിഘണ്ടുവിൽ വെറും "ഭ്രാന്തായി" ചിത്രീകരിച്ചിരിക്കുന്നു....!!

ഇത്രമാത്രം സന്തോഷത്തിന്റെ അവസ്ഥകളെ മനസ്സിലാക്കാത്ത വിധം മലയാളി തരം താണു പോയത് എന്തുകൊണ്ടാണ്
എന്ന് ചിന്തിക്കേണ്ടതുണ്ട്..!!

സ്വന്തമായി ജീവിക്കാതെ സ്വന്തമായി സന്തോഷിക്കാൻ സാധിക്കാതെ.....
എങ്ങനെയാണ് ഇവർ കാലം കഴിച്ചു കൂട്ടുന്നത്...

എന്തു കാര്യത്തിലും അതെത്ര നന്നായാലും അതിനെ അഭിനന്ദിക്കാൻ മലയാളി തയ്യാറാവില്ല....

"ഓ.. ഇതൊക്കെ എത്ര കണ്ടിരിക്കുന്നു...."

അല്ലെങ്കിൽ
 "ഇതൊക്കെ ഉടായിപ്പ് അല്ലെ "
ഇങ്ങനെയാവും പ്രതികരണം.....

ചങ്കെടുത്ത് കാണിച്ചാൽ ചെമ്പരത്തിപ്പൂവെന്ന് പറയുന്നവൻ മലയാളി...!!!

ടിപ്പിക്കൽ മലയാളിയുടെ കൈയ്യിൽ എപ്പോഴും ഒരു മുഴക്കോൽ കാണും.. മറ്റുള്ളവരെ അളക്കുക എന്നതു മാത്രമാണ് അവന്റെ ലക്ഷ്യം....
സ്വന്തം കാലിൽ മന്തു വെച്ചു കൊണ്ട് കാലുളുക്കിയവനെ കളിയാക്കുന്നവനാണവൻ...!!!

ഇതൊക്കെ കേരളത്തിൽ മാത്രം...!!
കേരളത്തിന്റെ അതിർത്തി കടന്നാൽ അത് ഉത്തരേന്ത്യയോ ഗൾഫ് നാടുകളോ അമേരിക്കയോ ആവട്ടെ അവൻ സ്മാർട്ട് ആകുന്നു...!!!
"മലയാളി മനോഭാവം" എടുത്ത് അട്ടത്തു വെക്കുന്നു...അല്ലെങ്കിൽ റിട്ടേൺ ടിക്കറ്റ് എടുക്കേണ്ടി വരുമെന്ന് അവനറിയാം...!!!

മലയാളിക്ക് മഴ ഭയങ്കരമാണ്, കാറ്റ് ഭീകരമാണ്, വെയിലോ അതി കഠിനമാണ്....!!!
നശിച്ച മഴ, മുടിഞ്ഞ ചൂട് ഒക്കെ അവന്റെ മാത്രം പ്രയോഗങ്ങളാകുന്നു...

ഭയങ്കരം,ഭീകരം, കഠിനം എന്ന വാക്കുകളെല്ലാം വരുന്നത് മലയാളിയുടെ നെഗറ്റീവായ മനോഭാവത്തിൽ നിന്നാണ്...

 മഴയ്ക്ക്  എങ്ങനെയാണ് ഭയങ്കരമാവാൻ കഴിയുക...
ശക്തമായ മഴ എന്നോ നല്ല മഴ എന്നോ ഒക്കെ പറയുകയല്ലേ നല്ലത്.

മഴയെയോ വെയിലിനെയോ നമുക്ക് നിയന്ത്രിക്കാൻ കഴിയില്ല എന്ന് നമുക്കറിയാം...
അപ്പോൾ  അങ്ങനെ ഒരു മഴ പെയ്യുമ്പോൾ അതിനോടൊന്നിച്ച് പോകാൻ അല്ലേ നാം ശ്രമിക്കേണ്ടത്..
ഒരു പീടികക്കോലായിൽ നിന്ന് ആ മഴ ഒന്നാസ്വദിയ്ക്കാൻ അവനു കഴിയില്ല...!!

അവന് അപ്പോഴും തിരക്കാണല്ലോ..
ട്രാഫിക് ലൈറ്റ് കേടായാൽ അവന് ഭ്രാന്തിളകും..!!!
ഏറ്റവും അധികം ഹോൺ
അടിക്കുന്നതും മലയാളി തന്നെ...!!!

ഇത്രയൊക്കെ പറയുമ്പോൾ നിങ്ങളും ഒരു മലയാളിയല്ലേ
എന്ന് ചോദിക്കുന്നവൻ ടിപ്പിക്കൽ മലയാളിയായിരിക്കും..!!!
അവന് ഈ പോസ്റ്റ്‌ ഷെയർ ചെയ്യാൻ ആവുകയില്ല....😂

13/02/2022, 9:11 pm - Renu CEA: '*വയസ്സ്.... ആയോ??!!* 😊

പണ്ടൊക്കെ 40 വയസ്സ് കഴിഞ്ഞാൽ ആളുകൾ വൃദ്ധരാകുമായിരുന്നു. സ്ത്രീകളാണെങ്കിൽ 35 വയസ്സിൽ തന്നെ പ്രായം ബാധിച്ചിട്ടുണ്ടാകും. വേഷവും ഭാവവും പ്രായക്കൂടുതലിനു സംഭാവന നൽകിയിരുന്നു. 

അക്കാലത്തെ 40+ ആൾക്കാരുടെ ജീവിതം കൊടും പ്രാരാബ്ധങ്ങളിൽ നീറി നീറിയാണ് വലിഞ്ഞു നീങ്ങിയിരുന്നത്. നല്ല വീടില്ല, ധാരാളം മക്കൾ, പെൺമക്കളുടെ വിവാഹം, വരുമാനക്കുറവ് അങ്ങനെ അനവധി വിഷയങ്ങൾ. ചിരിച്ച മുഖത്തോടെ ഒരാളെ കാണാൻ പ്രയാസം. (സാധാരണക്കാരുടെ കാര്യമാണ് പറയുന്നത്.)

കാലം കുറച്ചു കൂടി ചെന്നപ്പോൾ ആൾക്കാർ കുറച്ചു കൂടി ചെറുപ്പമായി. 50 വയസ്സ് കഴിയേണ്ടിവന്നു വൃദ്ധരോ മധ്യവയസ്കരോ ആകാൻ. പലർക്കും ജീവിതത്തിൽ എന്തെങ്കിലുമൊക്കെ സന്താഷിക്കാൻ ഉണ്ടായി. ഒന്നുമില്ലെങ്കിൽ ടിവിയിൽ സീരിയലുകൾ കണ്ടെങ്കിലും സന്തോഷിച്ചു.

ഇതാ പ്രായത്തിന്റെ അതിരളവുകൾ വീണ്ടും മാറിയിരിയ്ക്കുന്നു. 

WHOയുടെ പുതിയ തീയറി പ്രകാരം 18 വയസ്സു മുതൽ 65 വയസ്സുവരെ യൗവനകാലമാണ്.

66 മുതൽ 79 വരെ മധ്യവയസ്സും 80 നു മുകളിൽ വാർധക്യവുമാണ്!

സത്യം പറയാമല്ലോ, ഇപ്പോഴാ ഒന്ന് സമാധാനമായത്. 
ഇനി പ്രശ്നമില്ല, 
80 വരെ സമയമുണ്ടല്ലോ  🤪😉🤡🤷‍♂

Sharing my experience here....
Name of the suhruth : Rahul ER☺️☺️
First and foremost a big thank you to Rahul....
Matter : 
Enikku ee varunnu Shivaraatri dinathil Kollam Thrikkadavoor Kshetrathil parayeduppinu pangu cherendathund..... have been carrying on this tradition since years ......have always tried to be part of the parayeduppu and the festival which are very nostalgic for me ..... adooril padikkumbolum ithinu mudakkam varuthiyittilla..... adooril ninnum Kollam bus-IL kayari ente grandmother-nte veeetil njaan poyi kshethrathil shivaraatri koodi  adutha divasam thirich bus-IL adooril ethi class attend cheythirunnu 4 years.... Athra ere close to my heart aanu Thrikkadavoor Kshetram, ulsavam, and parayeduppu.

Ippravashyavum pokaan ulla thayyar eduppumaayi irikkave aaro paranjarinju that they have cancelled this year’s parayeduppu as all other temple festivals have been cancelled due to Covid 

One exact reason why I look forward every year to be back in Kollam is because of my nostalgia of 5 years of my prime time in Kollam with my grandparents and the big joint family.... appol ippravashyam parayeduppu illa ennu kettappol ticket cancel cheyendi varum alle ennu vichaarichirikke , I thought of trying the temple contact number to confirm.... but the number was out of service . 
Pinne raavile Muthal google search cheythu for new number or details of the festival .... onnum kittiyilla....

Niraashayode ettanodu ticket cancel cheyyaam ennu parayaan thidangiyappol aanu pettannu enikku orikkal nammude Rahul-maayi converse cheythappol Kittiya piece of information orma vannath.... that he works in the Kadavoor office branch 
Pinne samayam kalayyathe Rahuline msg cheyunnu  , kaaryangal thirakkunnu..... asked for new contact number ..... immediately the reply came that it has been disconnected. 
Vere enthengilum pomvazhi undo Rahulee Enna chodyathinu udan adutha marupadi.... he shared a colleague’s number who happens to be a temple devaswaom board member..... nokkane ee bhaagyam...thought of getting a general contact number , but got hold of ‘the’ right person himself. 

Kaaryangal thirakki.... March 1st thanne parayeduppu undu ... even got to know the exact time when they will be coming to my area to collect the para....

How did this all become possible.....?
Friendship and maintaining the contact ..  and actually talking about each other’s whereabouts .......
So hurrraaaaaah! Thanks to Rahuljiiiiiii..... I owe u !!! 
🥰🥰🙏🙏angane ticket cancel aakanda.... njaan ente kadavoor bhagavaante arkil santhoshathode Ethum.....💃🏻🙏

26/02/2022, 4:02 pm - Ratheesh Kamu: Thats very true. Every time such issues happen, we hope it does not go the League of nations way.. We can easily say so far it did a decent job to avoid such fate. Of course, there could be room for improvement and lets hope things get better along the way..

we're all ok..the CEA days were the immature days for most of us, we perhaps did not open up and and did not have many one to one interactions..everyoneto somelevel are introvert deep inside, that may have been the reason. (except Varkala- he was eccentric, and as you said must not have commented anything on anyone's FB, dunno what drives him, can't see those as jokes, sorry, totally unacceptable..!!!!)

31/03/2022, 1:42 am - GT Australia: True. Quality stuff should be made available to those who consume it. Now the 20s are going towards drugs, which is dangerous.

I was just pointing out the doublespeak of the party in power. We knew their pre election campaigns. Now kallu and lottery are the only way they know to generate revenue. Don't know what was their thought to source Krail the loan repayments

(We need a high-speed connectivity, Supporting next 25 -30 year demands..so a broadgauge or similar  , very much integrated to other transport  network,  as much as possible  eco friendly,  aligning existing railway wherever they can to reduce the cost and the land acquisition agonies. Transparent policies, Handsome compensation / reconstruction packages for those who may lose their property. But the way they run KSRTC or others don't give us a bright hope. The Srilankan comparison ( is not correct as just one state's fiscal issues can't get a country into such a situation ) but can very well drive into a very bad situation. Various discussion on this give us a feeling of a thattikkoot project and aimed at 'developing someone's pocket' :)

31/03/2022, 9:00 am - Ratheesh Kamu: Absolutely.. It shud be sold in normal shops. I don't understand the logic why people have to struggle so much by standing in queues in the scorching sun and heavy rain to buy it after paying such huge taxes..
31/03/2022, 9:08 am - Ratheesh Kamu: And for K-rail, i have a different opinion.. Development  should happen and it will happen. U cannot stop it. Of course, people will be anxious and sad that they are losing their homes. Their concerns should be properly addreessed. However, it is obvious that other parties' strike against it is politically motivated and not in the overall interest of the state. We common people will have to understand that if it doesn't materialise, these politicians would have gotten what they wanted..  Eventually we are the ones losing out on development..
31/03/2022, 9:55 am - GT Australia: Wasn't talking about the high speed concept,  Kerala needs it. But what's being done seems with very little homework and the actions, news give raise to lot of doubts. 

Address those who lose their lands, properties.
Do the stuffs that will help in a long run.. here it's standard gauge and read so many places that its not suitable if we go for high speeds later. And not integrated well with railways etc.

22/04/2022, 4:26 pm - Athira CEA: 3 വർഷത്തോളമായി, എന്റെ കൂടെ കൂടി ഒരു ചരടിൻ്റെ ബലത്തിൽ എന്നിലാധിപത്യം സ്ഥാപിച്ചിട്ട്. പലപ്പോഴും ഒഴിവാക്കണം എന്ന് കരുതിയിട്ടുണ്ട് കഴിഞ്ഞില്ല. കിടപ്പറയിൽ ഒപ്പം കൂട്ടാനുള്ള ഇഴയടുപ്പം ഉണ്ടായില്ല എങ്കിലും പുറത്തിറങ്ങുമ്പോൾ എപ്പോഴും കൂടെ കൂട്ടി ..

എന്റെ സങ്കടങ്ങളിലും സന്തോഷങ്ങളിലും കൂടെ തന്നെ നിന്നത് കൊണ്ട് ഒഴിവാക്കാനും തോന്നിയില്ല.

മനസ്സ് നൊന്തപ്പോഴൊക്കെ ചുണ്ടുവിതുമ്പിയപ്പോഴും കണ്ണുനീർ 
തുളുമ്പി കവിളിണ നനച്ചപ്പോഴും പുറത്താരുമറിയാതെ എനിക്കൊരു സാന്ത്വനമായ് കൂടെ നിന്നു.. 

എപ്പോഴോ ഞാനറിയാതെ തന്നെ സ്നേഹിച്ചു തുടങ്ങി.

ഏതൊരാൾക്കൂട്ടത്തിനു നടുവിലും എന്റെ സന്തോഷങ്ങളിൽ, പൊട്ടിച്ചിരിയിൽ, അത് മറ്റുള്ളവരുടെ ശ്രദ്ധയിൽ പെടാതെയും, മറ്റാരും അറിയിതെയിരിക്കാനും പ്രത്യേകം ശ്രദ്ധിച്ചിരുന്നു. പതിയെ പതിയെ ഞാൻ എന്റെ ജീവിതത്തിന്റെ ഭാഗമായി തന്നെ കൂടെ നിർത്തി..

പിന്നീടെപ്പഴോ ഞങ്ങൾ തമ്മിൽ അകന്നു തുടങ്ങി. പിന്നീടെങ്ങനെയെങ്കിലും ഒഴിവാക്കിയാൽ മതിയെന്നായി.

കൂടെയുള്ളപ്പോൾ പലപ്പോഴും ശ്വാസം മുട്ടുന്ന പോലെ തോന്നി.

കേസാവുമോയെന്ന് ഭയന്ന് ഞാൻ എന്റെ സ്വന്തം ഇഷ്ടപ്രകാരം ഒഴിവാക്കില്ല എന്നു തീരുമാനിച്ചു.                                 

എൻ്റെ മനസ്സറിഞ്ഞതുപോലെ എൻ്റെ കൂടെ കൂട്ടി വിട്ടവർ തന്നെ താല്പര്യമില്ല എങ്കിൽ ഒഴിവാക്കാം എന്ന തീരുമാനം അറിയിച്ചപ്പോൾ അല്പം ആശ്വാസമായി. ഒരു ശല്യം ഒഴിവായപോലെ തോന്നി...!

എങ്കിലും ഉള്ളിലെവിടെയോ ഒരു കുഞ്ഞു നൊമ്പരം ഉടലെടുത്തപ്പോൾ പത്രത്തിൽ വന്ന വാർത്ത ഞാനൊന്നുകൂടെ വായിച്ചു..!

"ഇനി മാസ്ക് ധരിക്കണമെന്ന് നിർബന്ധമില്ല. ആവശ്യമുള്ളവർക്കു ധരിക്കാം,മാസ്ക് ധരിക്കാത്തതിൻ്റെ പേരിൽ കേസെടുക്കുന്നതല്ല എന്നു സർക്കാർ തീരുമാനമായി.. "😍😄😄🙏 എങ്കിലും എൻ്റെ ഒരു സമാധാനത്തിന് പൊതു ഇടങ്ങളിൽ ഞാൻ ഇപ്പോഴും ഒപ്പം കൂട്ടാറുണ്ട്.😍🙏
22/04/2022, 5:00 pm - +91 94462 26739: ഒടുക്കത്തീന്നു വായിച്ചു തുടങ്ങിയതിനാൽ, ഞാൻ പെട്ടില്ല.😜

2. Njaan janichu valarnna Kollam, Trivandrum idangalil ente maatram convenience-il onnu pokaan 
3.friends-ne meet cheyyuka .... etc

If that is what is inferred , satyamada what you said .... to each letter !!
Ammayum pappayum ippol orupaadu vayassaayi.... athu vallapozhum maatram naatil njaan vannu avare pettannu kaanumbol , ethra maatram aged and weak aayi avar ennu njaan orupaadu vedanayode aanu ulkollaarullath...... I know .... in that context .... yes ... time is precious ...... the time that I get to spend with them....
Athu nadannittillaa... athum enikku paranjarikkaan kazhiyaathathinappuram manassil oru vedana aanu.... that I am unable to spend quality time with them or be of any help to them.....

21/06/2022, 9:06 am - Athira CEA: ഒരിടത്ത് ഒരു സ്വർണ്ണ 
വ്യാപാരിയുടെ മകളുണ്ടായിരുന്നു. .
കാണാൻ അതിസുന്ദരിയായിരുന്നവൾ.. 

അവളെ തന്നെക്കാൾ
വലിയൊരു
വ്യാപാരിയെക്കൊണ്ട്
വിവാഹം കഴിപ്പിക്കാൻ
അവളുടെ അച്ഛൻ ആഗ്രഹിച്ചു..👌👌

എന്നാൽ  നാട്ടിലുള്ള ഒരു
തൂപ്പ് കാരനുമായി അവൾ
പ്രണയത്തിലായിരുന്നു..💞💞

 അവരുടെ
ബന്ധത്തെ അവളുടെ അച്ഛൻ
എതിർത്തു.

ഒരു കാരണവശാലും വിവാഹം
നടത്തിക്കൊടുക്കില്ലെന്ന്
അയാള് തറപ്പിച്ചു പറഞ്ഞു..!😬😬

ഒടുവിൽ അവർ ഒളിച്ചോടാൻ
തീരുമാനിച്ചു.😉

അങ്ങനെയെങ്കിലും
സന്തോഷമായി കഴിയാൻ അവൾ
ആഗ്രഹിച്ചു. ☺

അങ്ങനെ പിറ്റേന്ന്
അവർ ഒരുപാട് ദൂരെയുള്ള ഒരു
നാട്ടിലേക്ക് ഒളിച്ചോടി..!🙄

തന്റെ മകൾ പോയതിൽ ആ അച്ഛൻ
അതീവ ദുഖിതനായി.. മകളെ
പിരിഞ്ഞിരിക്കുവാൻ അയാൾക്ക്
സാധിക്കുമായിരുന്നില്ല..🙁

ഒടുവിൽ അയാൾ തന്റെ മകളെ
തിരികെ വിളിക്കുവാൻ
തീരുമാനിച്ചു.. അതിനായി അയാൾ
എല്ലാ പത്രങ്ങളിലും പരസ്യം
ചെയ്തു.. 

തിരികെ വന്നാലുടൻ
നിങ്ങളുടെ വിവാഹം ചെയ്തു
തരാമെന്ന സന്ദേശമായിരുന്നു
അതിൽ.. ഈ പരസ്യം അവരുടെ
ശ്രദ്ധയിൽ പെടുകയും അവർ
വീട്ടിലേക്ക് തിരിച്ചു വരുകയും
ചെയ്തു.. 😃👍

അയാൾ അതീവ
സന്തോഷവാനായി.  അവരുടെ
വിവാഹം നടത്താനുള്ള ഒരുക്കങ്ങൾ
തുടങ്ങി..
വിവാഹത്തിനുള്ള
വസ്ത്രമെടുക്കാനായി അവൾ
തന്റെ ഭാവി വരന്റെ കൂടെ
പുറപ്പെട്ടു..☺

 നിർഭാഗ്യവശാല്‍
അവരുടെ വണ്ടിയിൽ ഒരു ലോറി
വന്നിടിക്കുകയും അവളുടെ
കാമുകൻ സംഭവ സ്ഥലത്ത് തന്നെ
മരണപ്പെടുകയും ചെയ്തു.😕😕😪

 അവൾക്ക്
ഒരു പോറൽ പോലും
പറ്റിയിട്ടുണ്ടായിരുന്നില്ല..
പക്ഷെ അവളുടെ വസ്ത്രത്തിൽ
മുഴുവൻ തന്റെ പ്രിയ കാമുകന്റെ
രക്തം പുരണ്ടു..
അവൾ അലമുറയിട്ടു കരയാൻ തുടങ്ങി..😪😪

സംഭവമറിഞ്ഞ് അവളുടെ അച്ഛൻ
വീണ്ടും ദുഖിതനായി..
അവളാകട്ടെ ആ രക്തം പുരണ്ട
വസ്ത്രവും കെട്ടിപ്പിടിച്ചു
എന്നും ഒരേ കരച്ചിൽ..😥

മാസങ്ങൾ പലത് കടന്ന്പോയി.
തന്റെ മകളുടെ ഈ അവസ്ഥ
എങ്ങേനെയെങ്കിലും
മാറ്റണമെന്ന് അയാൾ
ആഗ്രഹിച്ചു. തന്റെ സുഹൃത്തിന്റെ
മകനെക്കൊണ്ട് അവളുടെ
വിവാഹം നടത്താൻ അയാൾ
ഏർപ്പാട് ചെയ്തു.

 മനസില്ലാ
മനസ്സോടെ അവൾ സമ്മതിച്ചു..
ഒരിക്കൽ അയാള് ഉറങ്ങുമ്പോൾ
സ്വപ്നത്തിൽ ഒരു വൃദ്ധ
പ്രത്യക്ഷപ്പെട്ടു.. 

നിന്റെ മകളുടെ
വസ്ത്രത്തിൽ പറ്റിയിരിക്കുന്ന
കാമുകന്റെ രക്തക്കറ എത്രയും
പെട്ടെന്ന് പൂർണ്ണമായും കഴുകി
ക്കളയണമെന്നും ഇല്ലെങ്കിൽ
വലിയൊരപകടം
സംഭവിക്കുമെന്നും മുന്നറിയിപ്പ്
നല്കി..!
😳😳😳
 എന്നാൻ അയാൾ അത്
അവഗണിച്ചു.
അടുത്ത ദിവസം അവളുടെ അമ്മയുടെ
സ്വപ്നത്തിലും അതെ വൃദ്ധ
പ്രത്യക്ഷപ്പെടുകയും രക്തം 3
ദിവസത്തിനുള്ളിൽ കഴുകി
കളയണമെന്നും ആവശ്യപ്പെട്ടു.😳

എന്നാൽ അവരും അത്
അവഗണിച്ചു..
പിറ്റേ ദിവസം മകളുടെ
സ്വപ്നത്തിലും വൃദ്ധ ഇതേ കാര്യം
ആവശ്യപ്പെട്ടു.. 

ഇനി 2 ദിവസമേ
ബാക്കിയുള്ളൂ എന്ന് അറിയിച്ചു..😳😳
അവൾ ഉടൻതന്നെ ഇക്കാര്യം
തന്റെ മാതാപിതാക്കളോട്
പറഞ്ഞു. അപ്പോൾ അവരും ഇതേ
സ്വപ്നം കണ്ട കാര്യം അവളോട്
പറഞ്ഞു..!!😳😳😳

 ഇതും കൂടി കേട്ടപ്പോ
ഇത് സത്യമാണെന്ന്
അവൾക്കുറപ്പായി..
അവൾ ഭയന്ന് വിറച്ചു.😳🤪 വസ്ത്രം
എടുത്തു കഴുകാന് തുടങ്ങി.. എന്നാൽ
രക്തക്കറ കളയാൻ സാധിച്ചില്ല.!
അടുത്ത ദിവസവും വൃദ്ധ
സ്വപ്നത്തില് വന്ന് ഇനി ഒരു
ദിവസം മാത്രമേ
അവശേഷിക്കുന്നുള്ളൂ എന്ന്
മുന്നറിയിപ്പ് നല്കി..
അവൾ അന്ന് വീട്ടിൽ
ഒറ്റക്കായിരുന്നു.. 

അവള് രാത്രി
തന്നെ വസ്ത്രം എടുത്തു കഴുകാൻ
തുടങ്ങി.. എന്നാൽ എത്ര
ശ്രമിച്ചിട്ടും അവൾക്കാ
രക്തക്കറ കഴുകി കളയാൻ
സാധിച്ചില്ല.🤔🤔 പെട്ടെന്ന്
അവളുടെ വീടിന്റെ വാതിലിൽ
ആരോ മുട്ടുന്നത് കേട്ട് അവൾ ഭയന്ന്
വിറച്ചു..!! 

അവള് പതിയെ വാതിൽ
തുറന്നു നോക്കിയപ്പോൾ
സ്വപ്നത്തില് വന്ന അതെ വൃദ്ധ..!!!!!!🙄😳

അവള് ഭയന്ന് വിറച്ച്
അലറിക്കരയുവാൻ തുടങ്ങി...😪

വൃദ്ധ പതിയെ അവളുടെ
അടുത്തെത്തി കയ്യില് ഒരു പൊതി
കൊടുത്ത് അവളെ നോക്കി....
ഇങ്ങനെ പറഞ്ഞു...

ഏരിയൽ വാഷിങ് പൌഡർ 

ഏത് കടുത്ത കറകളെ നീക്കും
ഒരു വാഷിൽ തന്നെ

പാലുപോലെ വെണ്മാ...
തുണികൾക്ക് ഏകും മേന്മ...😜😂😂😂👍

ഏരിയൽ ഉപയോഗിക്കൂ…… കറകൾ...
മറന്നേക്കൂ.....

വായന ശീലം നല്ലതാ...😄 ഇതെങ്കിലും മുഴുവൻ ഒന്ന് വായിക്കാനുള്ള മനസ്സ് കാണിച്ചതിന്ന് നന്ദി!  നീളമുള്ള മെസ്സേജുകൾ വായിക്കുന്ന ശീലം കുറഞ്ഞ് വരികയാണ് ഇക്കാലത്ത്

എന്നെ തപ്പണ്ട...  ഞാനും പെട്ട് പോയതാണ്
ഇത് അയച്ച് തന്നവനെ നോക്കി ഞാന്‍ പുറപ്പെട്ടു കഴിഞ്ഞു ....🥱🥱🥱🥱😃😃😃😃

Happy വായന ശീലം

Scientist in Singapore are still trying to understand how Ratheesh is keeping his eternal youth.

 By the way there's a movie planned based on Ratheesh's life: "Curious case of Kamu Ratheesh"

05/07/2022, 12:36 pm - Athira CEA: എനിക്ക് ഏകദേശം 9 വയസ്സുള്ളപ്പോൾ, അച്ഛന്റെ, ഞാൻ അറിയാത്ത   ഒരു സുഹൃത്തിന്റെ ശവസംസ്കാരത്തിന് ശ്മശാനത്തില്‍ പോയിരുന്നു 

അവിടെ എത്തിയപ്പോൾ, സമയം പോകാത്തത് കൊണ്ട്  ഞാൻ കുറച്ച് മാറി ഒരു മൂലയില്‍ പോയി നിന്നു. 

അപ്പോൾ ഒരാൾ എന്നെ സമീപിച്ച് പറഞ്ഞു, 'ജീവിതം ആസ്വദിക്കാൻ ഉള്ളതാണ് മോനെ കഴിയുന്നതും അടിച്ചു പൊളിക്കാന്‍ പറഞ്ഞു.. 

എന്നിട്ട് എന്റെ തലയില്‍ കൈ വെച്ച് കൊണ്ട് ചിരിച്ചിട്ട് പോയി.. 

 മരിച്ചയാളോട് യാത്ര പറയാൻ അച്ഛൻ എന്നെ നിർബന്ധിച്ചു.
ഞാൻ ശവപ്പെട്ടിയിലേക്ക് നോക്കിയപ്പോൾ, ശവപ്പെട്ടിയിലുള്ള മനുഷ്യൻ എന്നോട് സംസാരിച്ച അതേ മനുഷ്യൻ തന്നെയാണെന്ന് കണ്ട് ഞാൻ ഭയന്നുപോയി!

അതിന് ശേഷം എനിക്ക് രാത്രി നന്നായി ഉറങ്ങാൻ കഴിയാതെ  ഭയങ്കര പേടി സ്വപ്നങ്ങൾ കാണാന്‍ തുടങ്ങി. ഒറ്റക്ക് ഇരിക്കാൻ എനിക്ക് പേടി ആയിരുന്നു.  വർഷങ്ങളോളം രാത്രി വെളിച്ചമില്ലാതെ എനിക്ക് ഉറങ്ങാൻ കഴിഞ്ഞില്ല.

എന്നെ പല മനശ്ശാസ്ത്രജ്ഞരെയും അടുത്ത് കാണിച്ചു. എന്റെ കൗമാര കാലത്ത് വളരെയധികം ബുദ്ധിമുട്ടുകൾ സഹിച്ചു.

പ്രായമാകുന്തോറും സുഖം പ്രാപിച്ചുവെങ്കിലും, ചില രാത്രികളില്‍ ഞാൻ ഇടയ്ക്കിടെ ഭയന്ന് നിലവിളിച്ചുകൊണ്ട് എഴുന്നേൽക്കും.

വർഷങ്ങൾക്കുശേഷം, എന്റെ ജീവിതത്തെ മാറ്റിമറിച്ച അവിശ്വസനീയമായ ആ സത്യം ഞാൻ കണ്ടെത്തി.



..... ചത്ത തെണ്ടിക്ക് ഒരു ഇരട്ട സഹോദരൻ ഉണ്ടായിരുന്നു എന്ന്..

 *അന്ന് അതൊരു വികാരമായിരുന്നു....*

*പുതിയ ജനറേഷനിൽ ഉള്ളവർക്ക് ഞാനീ പറയുന്ന കാര്യം ഒരു പക്ഷേ ഉൾക്കൊള്ളാൻ കഴിഞ്ഞുവെന്നു വരില്ല..*
*പത്താം ക്ലാസ്സിൽ ഞങ്ങളൊക്കെ പഠിക്കുന്ന കാലത്ത് ഓട്ടോഗ്രാഫ് എന്നൊരു സമ്പ്രദായമുണ്ടായിരുന്നു...*
*അന്ന് കൂടെ പഠിക്കുന്ന സുഹൃത്തുക്കളും, സഹപാഠികളും എഴുതിത്തന്ന വരികൾ ഇപ്പോൾ വായിക്കുമ്പോൾ ചിരിക്കണോ, അതോ കരയണോ എന്ന് പോലും അറിയുന്നില്ല...*
*എന്തായാലും ഒരു കാര്യം ഉറപ്പ്...*
*അന്നത്തെ ആ കുറിപ്പുകൾ ഇപ്പോൾ വായിക്കുമ്പോൾ ഒരു നെടുവീർപ്പ് അറിയാതെ നമ്മളിൽ നിന്നും ഉണ്ടാകും..*

*കൊക്കിനെന്തിന് കോൾഗേറ്റ്,*
*കാക്കക്കെന്തിന് കരിമഷി,*
*തത്തക്കെന്തിന് ലിപ്സ്റ്റിക്*

*ആഹാ..*
*വയലാർ എഴുതുമോ ഇതുപോലെ...???*

*കാലം മാറും,*
*കോലം മാറും,*
*നീ എന്നെ മറന്നാലും,*
*നിന്നെ ഞാന്‍ മറക്കില്ല..*
*എന്ന് പറഞ്ഞവരൊക്കെ ഇപ്പൊ കണ്ടാൽ തിരിച്ചറിയാൻ പറ്റാത്ത വിധം മാറിപ്പോയി....*

*ഭാവി ജീവിതം ഭാസുരമാക്കാൻ ഭർത്താവിനെ ഭരണിയിയിൽ ആക്കുക...*
*എന്ന് പറഞ്ഞവൾ ഇപ്പഴും കെട്ടിയിട്ടില്ല എന്നോർക്കുമ്പോളാണ് മനസ്സിനൊരു സമാധാനം....*

*പാടത്തെ കിളിയെ സ്നേഹിച്ചാലും, പറമ്പിലെ കിളിയെ സ്നേഹിച്ചാലും, ബസിലെ കിളിയെ സ്നേഹിക്കല്ലേ,*
*എന്നെഴുതിയവളിപ്പോ  ബസിലെ കിളിയുടെ പിള്ളേരുടെ അമ്മയാണ്....* 

*വിശാല മനസ്സേ,*
*വിരോധമരുതേ,*
*വിധിയുണ്ടെങ്കിൽ വീണ്ടും കാണാം,*
*എന്ന് എഴുതിയവന് പിന്നെ എന്നെ കാണാൻ വിധിയുണ്ടായില്ല എന്നത് പച്ചപ്പരമാർത്ഥം....*

*അനന്തമായ നീലാകാശത്ത്,*
*മേഘങ്ങൾ തമ്മിൽ അകലുന്നത് പോലെ, നാം തമ്മിലുള്ള സ്നേഹബന്ധം അകലാതിരിക്കട്ടെ..*
*എന്നെഴുതിയവളെ നേരിട്ട് കണ്ടിട്ട് നാല് പതിറ്റാണ്ട് കഴിഞ്ഞു...*

*B.A മറന്നാലും,*
*M.A മറന്നാലും,*
*N.A(എന്നെ) മറക്കരുത്...* *എന്നെഴുതിയവന്റെ പേരല്ലാതെ അവന്റെ മുഖം പോലും ഞാനിപ്പോ ഓർക്കുന്നില്ലല്ലോ....!!!*
*ഇനിയിപ്പോൾ അവനെങ്ങാനും എന്റെ മുന്നിൽ വന്നു നിന്നു ഞാൻ നിന്റെ പഴയ കൂട്ടുകാരനാടാ എന്ന് പറഞ്ഞാൽ ചിലപ്പോഴെന്റെ ഓർമ്മശക്തി  തിരിച്ചു കിട്ടിയേക്കാം....*
*ചിലപ്പോൾ മാത്രം....*

*വർഷങ്ങൾ കഴിഞ്ഞാലും,*
*വൃക്ഷങ്ങൾ കൊഴിഞ്ഞാലും,*
*നീ എന്നെ മറന്നാലും,*
*ഞാൻ നിന്നെ മറക്കില്ല...*
*എന്ന് നടുപേജിൽ  ചുവന്ന മഷിയിൽ അടയാളപ്പെടുത്തിയവളെ.*.
*നീയിപ്പോൾ എവിടെയാണ്....???*

*പഠിച്ചു പഠിച്ചു നീ ഡോക്ടറായാൽ,*
*പനിച്ചു പനിച്ചു ഞാൻ വരുമ്പോൾ,*
*ഫീസ് വാങ്ങാൻ മറക്കല്ലേ സോദരി...*
*ഞാൻ അന്ന് അങ്ങിനെ പറഞ്ഞത് കൊണ്ട് മാത്രം അവൾ പഠിച്ച് ഡോക്ടറായി.*
*ഞാൻ പനിയും പിടിച്ചിവിടെ വീടിന്റെ ഉമ്മറത്തിണ്ണയിൽ ചുക്ക് കാപ്പിയും കുടിച്ച് വെയിലിനെയും നോക്കിയിരിക്കുന്നു...*
*ഹാ യോഗമില്ലുണ്ണിയെ....* 

*ശാസ്ത്രം മുന്നോട്ട്,*
*മൂത്രം താഴോട്ട്,*
*നീ എങ്ങോട്ട്...???*
*ഓട്ടോഗ്രാഫിൽ ആരെങ്കിലും ഇങ്ങനെയൊക്കെ എഴുതുമോ...???*
*പക്ഷേ..*
*അങ്ങിനെയും എഴുതിക്കണ്ടു...*

*എന്റെ കരളിന്റെ കരളായ കുളിരെ,*
*വരൂ നമുക്ക് ചരലിൽ കിടന്നുരുളാം..*
*എന്ന് ഓട്ടോഗ്രാഫിൽ എഴുതികൊടുത്തവനെ അന്വേഷിച്ച് പെൺകുട്ടിയുടെ ആങ്ങളമാർ സ്കൂളിൽ വന്നിരുന്നു...*

*W.C(വെഡിങ് കാർഡ് )അയക്കാൻ മറന്നാലും,*
*D.C(ഡെത്ത് കാർഡ് )അയക്കാൻ മറക്കരുത്..*
*എന്നെഴുതിവനെ കല്യാണം വിളിച്ചിട്ട് പോലും അവൻ വന്നില്ല.*
*ഇനി ഞാൻ ചാകുമ്പോ വരാൻ എന്റെ ഡെത്ത് കാർഡും നോക്കി ഇരിക്കുകയായിരിക്കും...*
*ബ്ലഡി ഗ്രാമവാസി...*

*നമ്മൾ ദൂരെ ദൂരെ ഒരു ദിക്കിലേക്കുള്ള യാത്രയിലാണ്. അതിനിടയിൽ ഒന്ന് വിശ്രമിക്കാൻ വേണ്ടി മാത്രമാണ് ഇവിടെ കൂടിയിട്ടുള്ളത്.*
*ഈ യാത്രയുടെ അവസാനം എന്താകുമെന്ന്‌ അറിയില്ല സഹോദരാ...*
*ആഹാ..*
*ഈ ഫിലോസഫി എഴുതിയവനെ വർഷങ്ങൾക്ക് ശേഷം  നെടുമ്പാശ്ശേരിയിൽ വെച്ച് കണ്ടു....*
*അവനിപ്പോഴും യാത്രയിലാണ്..*

*മറവി മരുന്നാക്കി മാറ്റിയാലും,*
*മായ സ്വപ്നങ്ങളിൽ മയങ്ങിയാലും, മരിക്കാത്ത ഓർമകളെന്നും മനസിന്റെ  താളം തകർക്കും...*
*ഇതെഴുതിയ ആളെ  ഓർമ്മയിലില്ലെങ്കിലും അവരെഴുതിയത് സത്യമാണെന്ന് പലപ്പഴും എനിക്ക് തോന്നിയിട്ടുണ്ട്...*

*പത്തിലെ ഓട്ടോ ഗ്രാഫൊക്കെ കൈയിൽ ഉണ്ടെങ്കിൽ ഇടക്കൊക്കെ അതൊന്നു മറിച്ചു നോക്കണം.*
*ഓർമ്മകളുടെ ആ താളുകൾ മറിക്കുമ്പോൾ അറിയാതെ തന്നെ നമ്മുടെ മുഖത്തുമൊരു പുഞ്ചിരി വിരിയും.*
*ചിലരൊക്കെ എഴുതിപ്പിടിപ്പിച്ചിരിക്കുന്ന പൊട്ടത്തരങ്ങൾ  വായിച്ചു നോക്കുമ്പോൾ ചിരിച്ചു ചിരിച്ചൊരു വഴിക്കാകും.*

*ടാബും, മൊബൈലും, ലാപ്ടോപ്പുമൊക്കയായി നടക്കുന്ന ഇപ്പഴത്തെ പിള്ളേർക്കറിയുമോ ഓട്ടോഗ്രാഫ്  എഴുതിക്കാൻ ക്ലാസ്സുകൾ  തോറും കയറിയിറങ്ങി നടന്ന പണ്ടത്തെ പത്താം ക്ലാസ്സ്‌  പിള്ളേരുടെ മനസ്സിന്റെ വെപ്രാളം...*

*ഹാ...*
*അതൊക്കെ ഒരു കാലം...*
*ഒരിക്കലും തിരിച്ചു കിട്ടാത്ത സുവർണ കാലം...*

👆My day
My memories👇
Pandu schoolilum collegelum laddu and chocolates vitharanam cheyyumaayirunnu. 
I still remember my bday first time in our college.... S1 semester.... it was in our KIP red brickwalled classroom . As I entered the doorless opening to the classroom, Prashanth started whistling the happy birthday tune ( oh! God he was so perfect in whistling 🙏🥰) and one by one whistling tunes started to sync in to a chorus.... it was ‘the’ huge chest-tightening-with -joy moment....that was the greatest birthday ever to date!
I was happily awkward with my emotions on that day and will take that moment with me to the grave ☺️
22/07/2022, 8:49 am - Devi CEA: Thankyou for the memory... I remember this whistling incident like yesterday..... Umesh and all were whistling ... Also you had distributed some Munthiya inam sweet.... 😂....also the temple visit that you so systematically did.
22/07/2022, 8:59 am - Athira CEA: 😃😄😄❤️❤️❤️.... ah yes! The temple visits .... half sareeyum ittu 😂kulipinnalum poovum .... “enthokke aayirunnu.. Malappuram kathi, machine gun, bomb, olakkede moodu”
....ippol templeum illa(Hyderabadil we don’t get to see the conceptual temples we are used to in kerala.... hope Umesh agrees with me 😬) kuliyum illa😝pinnalum illa poovum illa.... hair ullathu chakiri pole Vaari clip cheythu loha polathe oru dress valichu vaari ittu oru ottamaaa.....😅
22/07/2022, 9:10 am - Athira CEA: Though I treat my bday as any other day.... let me say this that I totally ,truly adore those who make it a celebration.... I love seeing such enthusiastic people planning bdays right from the start of the bday month, dieting to get into the costly dress, getting the dresses stitched with frequent visits to the tailor or boutique, visiting the parlour, and on the D-day, celebrating it to the max with friends, family,outings, parties,biriyani, ice creams etc etc ....becoz they remind me that we all have less than 100 default birthdays for all you know.... make them last.. a celebration every year..... which makes life interesting 🥳😍
